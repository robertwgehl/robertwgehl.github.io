I"≠<p>This post is to test Staticman comments. I‚Äôll edit this post later to update my progress. For now, if anyone stumbles across this and wants to add a ‚Äútest‚Äù comment or something helpful, feel free!</p>

<p>I‚Äôm basing this process of this <a href="https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2020/02/05/now-with-comments.html">helpful blog post</a> from Travis Downs of Performance Matters. Thank you!</p>

<p>Update 1: There are clearly problems in my configuration, and so I must keep debugging. But it‚Äôs time for a walk.</p>

<p>Update 2: Success in posting a comment after turning ReCaptcha off. However, not sure if I set things up to <em>display</em> the comment‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Update 3: Success in getting a comment posted! But the workflow is very convoluted. I know Staticman uses Github pull requests to work, so I have to merge each comment. That‚Äôs fine. However, after I do so, I will have to move the data from my local version of my static site and then rebuild it via Jekyll. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INX-KrjaNOo">There has to be a better way</a>! And I will figure it out.</p>

<p>And, I do know I will have to style the comments, as well. One thing at a time.</p>
