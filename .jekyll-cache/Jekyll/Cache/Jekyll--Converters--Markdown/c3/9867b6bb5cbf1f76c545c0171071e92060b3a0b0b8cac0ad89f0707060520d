I"^<p>There have been a lot of books that have influenced my career: Fred Turner’s <em>From Counterculture to Cyberculture,</em> Gabriella Coleman’s <em>Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy,</em> Karl Marx’s <em>Grundrisse,</em> John Law’s <em>Aircraft Stories,</em> and Patricia Hill Collin’s <em>Black Feminist Thought.</em> These works are a kind of well to return to, again and again, to quench intellectual thirsts: thinking historically about communication technologies, and thinking about heterogeneity in the cultures of communication technologies.</p>

<p>But perhaps the closest to my heart, one of the books that came along at just the right moment in my career – a bubbling spring of the well – is Scott Rosenberg’s <a href="http://www.dreamingincode.com/"><em>Dreaming In Code</em></a>.</p>
