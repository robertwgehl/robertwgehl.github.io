I"ﬁ<p>On October 18, at 8.30 am, a group of about 30 Internet Scholars gathered for a Association of Internet Researchers preconference, called ‚ÄúBuilding an Alternative Social Media Network.‚Äù</p>

<p>Organized by Jessa Lingel, Ashwin Nagappi, and myself, the preconference achieved one of its big goals: getting many researchers in a room to talk about alternative social media (ASM). Yay!</p>

<p>The other big goal was igniting a research agenda for ASM. Did we succeed?</p>
