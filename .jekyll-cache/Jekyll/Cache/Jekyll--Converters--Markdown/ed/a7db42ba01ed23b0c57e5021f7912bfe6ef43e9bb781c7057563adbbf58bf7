I"d	<p>Ok, you all probably remember last fall, when the Muskening happened. When Mastodon saw a massive influx of new members. When Mastodon admins were struggling to keep up with the influx but ultimately showed that the network can, in fact, scale up. It was, in my view, the biggest stress on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a> protocol – and ActivityPub kicked ass. Millions of people signed up for Mastodon.</p>

<p>That’s the titular Mastodon “bump.”</p>

<p>Since I’ve published academic articles on Mastodon, during that Eternal Muskvember, I was approached by a lot of journalists (<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-users-mastodon-meltdown/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/ninetonoon/audio/2018866818/twitter-users-seek-alternative-to-musk-run-platform">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/shows/make-me-smart/unpacking-mastodon/">here</a>, for example) to talk about Mastodon, answering questions ranging from “what is it?” to “will it replace Twitter?” It was an exciting and sometimes exasperating time. I basically told myself, “self, this sort of media attention is rare. Enjoy it, but know that it won’t last.” And indeed, a few weeks later, the story died down.</p>

<p>I also told myself to expect the inevitable follow-up. That’s what I’m writing about here.</p>

<p>As many readers of this blog are likely aware, after the new year, Mastodon’s active user base dropped off. As with every wave of social media movement from platform to platform, some percentage of people just don’t stick with the new site.</p>

<p>There’s the titular Mastodon “slump.”</p>

<p>Last week, I got an interview request from WIRED’s Amanda Hoover, who was working on a story about how Mastodon’s drop in active users signaled that it had failed in its mission to replace Twitter.</p>

<p>Now, before I go any further I will say Hoover’s reporting on Mastodon has been excellent. She asks great questions, and she does more than just interview Eugen Rochko – she talks to instance admins, lawyers, and academics like myself. And, in fact, the article I’m going to critique is quite good.</p>

<p>But I am going to use her latest WIRED article to illustrate an all-too-common trope in reporting on alternative social media: it’s what I call “The Killer Hype Cycle.”</p>
