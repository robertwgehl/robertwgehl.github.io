I"0<p>Somewhat different than what the main work being referred to here, but overlapping.  Following the advice of my in house technical expert (Huxley, age 10 at the time) and some high school students my wife supervises in the Science Bowl, I’ve been using discord for immediate, organized conversations. So as an example, four or five of us are attending (on line) a meeting of our state political party – we are all activists that run a large caucus with in that party addressing the environment – so as the process of the meeting unfolds, and our interests are potentially advanced or threatened by this or that motion or other event, we are in a private conversation that can be, once it is all over, deleted or archived as needed.  Like using the private chat function in a Zoom meeting, but the private chat is not private.</p>

<p>A second example: One person is at a meeting where they represent climate science, essentially testifying in a public meeting. Four of us are on a discord server (where there is a chat channel set up) and inserting helpful comments, references, etc. So it is like her notes being used to address questions during testimony are magical and update themselves in response to the questions.</p>

<p>So discord is not a tool for long term collaboration, but rather, to substitute for either the bar at an academic conference that is on line, or as a smoky back room to discuss policy on the fly, or as a tool in dynamic collaboration during key interactions.</p>

<p>It is designed to be a hyper-fancy low resource use SMS system for gamers.</p>
