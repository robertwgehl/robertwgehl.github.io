I"ü<p>With my <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/social-engineering">last book</a> wrapped up, I am now hard at work building the next book, which is the Goal 2 of this blog. (Goal 1, recall, is writing about being a FOSS academic. Goal 2 is writing a book about FOSS). My new book project will focus on what I‚Äôm calling <a href="https://fossacademic.tech/2022/01/06/Goal2.html">‚Äúethical source alternative social media‚Äù</a> ‚Äì social media that allows ordinary people to be in control, that uses moderation for social, economic, and environmental justice and not to support oppression, and that runs on FOSS.</p>

<p>Methodologically, this project will demand I use my expertise in software studies, science and technology studies, and critical communication studies to analyze code, protocols, and network structures. But I also want to use participant observation and interviewing. And, I want this to adhere to the highest ethical standands as well as use FOSS technologies throughout.</p>

<p>I want to include the voices of ethical ASM members, developers, and admins. It may be tempting to do what a lot of people seem to have done and quote fediverse posts. However, I‚Äôve observed that many, many fediverse users do not consent to having their posts taken out of context. There are public forums I can quote ‚Äì for example, the <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/discussions">Github issues forum for Mastodon</a>. But I think the best vehicle to hear people talk about their experience with ethical ASM is via interviewing.</p>

<p>In this post I will briefly describe how I will manage interviewing. I hope this resource is useful not just to other researchers, but also to anyone considering being interviewed by me who might be curious about my process.</p>
