<p>Nate Tkacz, Carlos CÃ¡mara-Menoyo, and Fangzhou Zhang put on a wonderful, and intensive, two days focused on Mastodon and the broader fediverse.</p>

<p>Particularly of value, I thought, was the second day, which was unfortunately not streamed. We gathered together to talk about research ethics and methods. I posted some notes about what we said on the fediverse, using the <a href="https://aoir.social/tags/mastosymposium">#MastoSymposium hashtag</a>.</p>

<p>In my view, one of the most important conversations we need to have â€“ and openly have â€“ is about research ethics <em>with</em> the fediverse. I talked about this at length <a href="https://nextcloud.robertwgehl.org/index.php/s/G34Y5X2PoNBq5Xp">in my plenary presentation</a>.</p>

<p>And the point was hammered home for me on day 2 by the <a href="https://systerserver.net/">SysterServer</a> collective, a group that hosts some instances and who attended the workshop. They arenâ€™t academics, so they arenâ€™t concerned with filling up CVs. But they have needs. Ethical research <em>with</em> them could help address their needs. Our research ought to resonate with the fediverse.</p>

<p>So whatâ€™s next? I believe we can continue this conversation at the <a href="https://aoir.org/aoir2023/preconfworkshops/#building">AOIR preconference</a> that several of us are hosting.</p>

<p>And of course, letâ€™s keep talking research ethics on the fediverse â€“ a conversation that has been happening for years â€“ see <a href="https://apintandaparma.club/katlh/research-ethics-and-the-fediverse">here</a> and <a href="https://blogghoran.se/2020/01/27/on-scraping-mastodon/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.sunclipse.org/wp-content/downloads/2020/01/open-letter.html">here</a> for just three examples.</p>
