I"¥<p>Iâ€™ve been messinâ€™ about with <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">Wireguard</a> and â€“ after some hiccups â€“ I have a small network of peers connected. I now have a couple laptops, a desktop, a phone, and a Raspberry Pi all networked, with the connection remaining persistent even as the mobile devices move across wi-fi networks.</p>
