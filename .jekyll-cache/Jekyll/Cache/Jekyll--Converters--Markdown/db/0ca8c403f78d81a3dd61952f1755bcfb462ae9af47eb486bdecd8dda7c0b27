I"¸<p><em>NB: This is the second in a series of posts where I will share my notes on my readings of the minutes of the Social Web Working Group. The <a href="/2023/01/20/ActivityPub1.html">first one is here</a>. Future posts to come.</em></p>

<p>As I mentioned several months ago, my book about Mastodon and the rest of the fediverse canâ€™t be complete without a deep understanding of ActivityPub, the protocol that powers the fediverse. ActivityPub itself is getting a bit of love in the press (see this <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/20/23689570/activitypub-protocol-standard-social-network"><em>Verge</em> article</a> for an example).</p>

<p>And to understand ActivityPub, we have to look at the group that created it, the W3Câ€™s Social Web Working Group, or SocialWG for short. They posted their meeting minutes on the Web and I have read <em>all of them.</em></p>

<p>In the previous post on the SocialWG minutes, I focused on the very early years, 2014 to 2015, finding that the period was dominated by organizational issues â€“ how to meet, how to make decisions, and so on. In this section, I will cover the development of ActivityStreams 2.0, the first goal of the SocialWG charter.</p>
