<p>Today, I signed an offer to join York University in Toronto as the Ontario Research Chair of Digital Governance for Social Justice. If you’re reading that job title and thinking “that’s a really good fit for the <a href="/2022/01/06/Goal2.html">Goal 2, ethical alternative social media book project</a>!”, you’d be right. The central project I’m blogging about here on FOSS Academic is <em>exactly</em> what I’d be pursuing at York.</p>

<p>More to come, but I just wanted to break the silence a bit – in between doing all the paperwork that comes with moving, of course!</p>
