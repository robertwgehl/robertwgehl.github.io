I"•<p>So I tried to take part in Fediforum today, but I wasnâ€™t really able to participate. My initial idea was to get into a debate with my friend <a href="https://test.roelof.info/">Roel Roscam Abbing</a>, who is an incredibly deep thinker and is writing what will no doubt be a foundational dissertation about the fediverse. We were hoping to prompt a discussion about importable, instance blocklists.</p>

<p>He and I disagree their utility. He thinks theyâ€™re bad; I think theyâ€™re good. Iâ€™ll let him post his reasons why, but here I wanted to share my defense of them. What follows is a longer version of what I planned on presenting at Fediforum.</p>
