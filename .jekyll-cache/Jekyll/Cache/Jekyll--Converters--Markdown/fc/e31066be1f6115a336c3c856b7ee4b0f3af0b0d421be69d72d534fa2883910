I"„<p>I have made good experience with Qoppa PDF Studio (https://www.qoppa.com/pdfstudio/). Although it is not FOSS, the developers react quickly and provide comprehensive feed-back. There are academic licenses: https://kbpdfstudio.qoppa.com/student-education-and-non-profit-discount/ It replaces Adobe Acrobat Professional in almost all aspects, I even like the UX better in PDF Studio</p>
