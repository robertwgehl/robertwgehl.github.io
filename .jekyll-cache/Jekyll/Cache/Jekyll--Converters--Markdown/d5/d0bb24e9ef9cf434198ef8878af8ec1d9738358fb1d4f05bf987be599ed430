I"l<p>As part of Goal 2 of this blog, I’m writing a book about FOSS, specifically FOSS alternative social media. As like any good academic, I need to review the literature. I want to do so a bit more publicly than I have in the past – hence this blog.</p>

<p>In fact, I’ve already started the process a bit: early on this blog went a bit viral <a href="2020/12/06/Dreaming-In-Code.html">thanks to my post about Scott Rosenberg’s <em>Dreaming in Code.</em></a>, which was linked by Hacker News. I also wrote <a href="2021/03/28/RMMess.html">a review of sorts of Sam Williams’s <em>Free as in Freedom,</em></a> a biography of Stallman. I just so happened to finish reading that book when Stallman was reinstated to the FSF, which made my post a bit more polemical than review.</p>

<p>This time, I’m going to turn to a modern classic: Gabriella Coleman’s <em>Coding Freedom: The Ethics and Aesthetics of Hacking.</em>

<p>Coleman is a trained anthropologist, engaging in deep hanging out, and in the early 2000s she turned her attention to one of the most important FOSS projects out there: Debian.</p>
