I"Ú<p>The Altair (described by Coleman 65) sounds so much like the Pi. And the pinephone.</p>

<p>These devices change our relationship to computing.</p>

<p>The Altair could be seen as a â€œpersonal liberation technologyâ€ in the sense that Fred Turner speaks of.</p>

<p>Do we think of the later devices the same way? Or does the fact that these are both networked and now mobile change the equation?</p>

<p>I would say so.</p>

<p>The context is different, for one â€“ we have a centralization of data-gathering now. Networks of devices are tethered to centralized corporate entities â€“ the appliance model Zittrain warned us about many years ago.</p>

<p>Devices that are not â€œphoning homeâ€ are valuable additions.</p>

<p>Unlike the shift from hobbyist personal computing to the big business PCs would become in the late 1970s and early 1980s (Campbell-Kelly), these devices are late to the game. Phones are dominated, and of course we already have computers lying around.</p>
