I"ç<p>I used an exclamation point intentionally, because the <a href="https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/appointments">Appointments app for Nextcloud</a> is just that awesome.</p>

<p>As a professor, I keep office hours and encourage students to meet with me. And, I also need to advise graduate students at various institutions around the world. And this is not to mention meeting with other professors I‚Äôm collaborating with ‚Äì again, from around the world.</p>

<p>In the past, setting up meetings went a bit like this:</p>

<p>Them: Hey, can we meet? 
Me: Sure! When do you want to meet?
Them: I‚Äôm free Mondays and Fridays. 
Me: How about noon on Monday?
Them: Actually, I have an appointment them. What day of the week works for you?
Me: Wednesdays and Fridays.
Them: Great! What about 1 on Wednesday?
Me: Sure! 
Them: What timezone are you in?
Me: Central.
Them: Oh! Then 1 pm for you is 9 pm for me.</p>

<p>Etc, etc. Each of these being an email, of course, and usually with a delay of several hours between them.</p>

<p>As they used to say in the commercials, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs got to be a better way!‚Äù</p>

<p>Nextcloud Appointments is that better way.</p>
