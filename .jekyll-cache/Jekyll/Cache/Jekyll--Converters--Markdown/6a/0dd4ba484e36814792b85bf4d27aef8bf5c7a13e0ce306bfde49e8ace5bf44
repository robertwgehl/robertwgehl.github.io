I"x<p><a href="https://linuxunplugged.com/">Linux Unplugged</a> is at it again: it’s Tuxies time! I voted, and <a href="https://tuxies.party">you can, too</a>. Unlike last year, this year they’re using a self-hosted Nextcloud form – brilliant! Like <a href="2020/12/10/The-Tuxies-Academic-Style.html">last year</a>, I’ve voted based on my experience as a FOSS Academic. My picks may not win – but they might just help you live the FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream.</p>
