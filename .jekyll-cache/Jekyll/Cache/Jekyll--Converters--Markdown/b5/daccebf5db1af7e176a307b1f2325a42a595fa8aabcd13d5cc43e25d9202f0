I"è<p>A quick note to any readers in GDPR regulated areas: Iâ€™m in the USA, and I donâ€™t really do business in Europe. I donâ€™t really do business anywhere, to be honest. Anyway, I also really respect privacy concerns. So, in the interest of transparency, I want to note that I use a <a href="https://www.statcounter.com">Statcounter</a> script to help track traffic to this blog.</p>

<p>You can see the Javascript in the page source for the blog, and Iâ€™ve also <a href="https://statcounter.com/p5832197/summary/?account_id=1462290&amp;login_id=3&amp;code=6a0a1540cdf3119c0be6e16464d0d1fe&amp;guest_login=1">made the stats public</a> (marvel at my traffic!).</p>

<p>If you block Javascript, I not only donâ€™t mind, nothing should change for you. The site will function just fine with Javascript blocked.</p>

<p>Moreover, if you have a better way to get basic traffic data for a Github.io-hosted static Jekyll blog, let me know in the comments or via Mastodon (@robertwgehl@scholar.social).</p>
