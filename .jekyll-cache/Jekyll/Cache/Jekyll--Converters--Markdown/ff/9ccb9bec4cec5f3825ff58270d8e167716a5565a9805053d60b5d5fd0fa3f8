I"Ï<p>A <a href="https://destinationlinux.org/episode-198/">recent <em>Destination Linux</em> podcast</a> interviewed Neal Gompa, a Fedora contributor, and their first question was: how did you start using Linux? I wonâ€™t recap Gompaâ€™s story â€“ Iâ€™d recommend listening to the show â€“ but suffice it to say it involves an old copy of Red Hat he randomly found.</p>

<p>I thought about Gompaâ€™s story and the question of getting started with FOSS and started reflecting on my own FOSS journey. As an academic â€“ and a non-computer science academic, at that â€“ I think my story is pretty unique.</p>

<p>It all started with Windows Vista.</p>
