I"s<p>So, as I noted in the <a href="/2023/03/03/AOIR-social.html">last post</a>, AoIR.social is <a href="https://aoir.social">live</a>! It’s in beta testing, so to speak, as we bring on board moderators to learn the system before rolling out to the Association of Internet Researchers membership.</p>

<p>And moderators can’t <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1plPyJdXKIY">mount up</a> and moderate without a Code of Conduct. Along with Sarah Roberts and Aram Sinnreich, we drafted a COC based on the successful one found at <a href="https://scholar.social">scholar.social</a>. We posted it to AoIR.social this week, and the moderators are weighing in.</p>

<p>This post is meant to document this process, not just for posterity, but also for the Fediverse writ large. Below, I’ll post the full AoIR.social COC and document the feedback the moderators are giving it.</p>
