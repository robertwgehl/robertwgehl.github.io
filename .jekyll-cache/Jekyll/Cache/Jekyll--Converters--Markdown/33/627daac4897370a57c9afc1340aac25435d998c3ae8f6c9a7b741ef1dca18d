I"´<p>As Iâ€™ve written before, Iâ€™m working on a book about the fediverse. To do that properly, I need to have a good understanding of ActivityPub, a key underlying protocol that enables servers to talk to one another. A member of one ActivityPub-enabled server, such as Mastodon, can connect with another on a different server â€“ even if it runs different software, such as Pixelfed. Itâ€™s quite a technical achievement and â€“ I believe â€“ it really needs to be part of the conversation when we discuss things like moderation, platform governance, and the political economy of the internet.</p>

<p>I like to study how such software develops over time, so Iâ€™ve been going through the <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg">meeting minutes of the W3C Social Web Working Group</a>. Itâ€™s been fascinating to see how they, for example, discuss <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/Social_API/User_stories">user stories</a> and how they inform the protocolâ€™s functionality.</p>

<p>I posted a short note about doing this work on my home Mastodon instance, scholar.social, and people noticed! This is what I love about scholar.social â€“ when I talk about geeking out about something, people jump in. Another fediverse member suggested I take a look at <a href="https://yewtu.be/watch?v=c17gjxEoyMQ">this weekâ€™s FOSS Find</a>. And now, Iâ€™m writing up notes about it â€“ at the request of the author of the Find. Read more after the jump.</p>
