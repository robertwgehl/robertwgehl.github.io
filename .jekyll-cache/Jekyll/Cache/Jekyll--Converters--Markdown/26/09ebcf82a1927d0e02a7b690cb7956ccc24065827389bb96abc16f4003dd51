I"&<p>This is a minor update, but I hope it’s useful to anyone interested in doing alternative social media research. I’ve long hosted a Zotero group, the <a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/542752/social_media_alternatives_project_bibliography">Social Media Alternatives Project</a>, which has a library. As much as I love Zotero, though, I’ve not had much luck with groups for fostering public discussion. Their libraries are a bit too tucked away.</p>

<p>Since many people are requesting resources about ASM, and that Zotero library may not be the easiest thing to find, I’m going to regularly port that library to a <a href="../bib.html">Bibliography</a> page on this blog. I’ve got to do some cleaning up, but there’s some good stuff in there. As Steve Brule might say: check it out!</p>
