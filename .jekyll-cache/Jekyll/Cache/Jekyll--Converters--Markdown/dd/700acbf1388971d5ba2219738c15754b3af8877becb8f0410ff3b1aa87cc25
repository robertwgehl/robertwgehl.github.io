I"<p><em>NB: I just <a href="https://theconversation.com/citizens-social-media-can-provide-an-antidote-to-propaganda-and-disinformation-192491">published a piece in_ The Conversation</a> _about a recent Pew Research report, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2022/10/06/the-role-of-alternative-social-media-in-the-news-and-information-environment/">â€œThe Role of Alternative Social Media in the News and Information Environmentâ€</a>. I argue that the authors get â€œalternative social media â€œ wrong. I lay out some of my concerns in that</em> Conversation <em>piece, but I only had about 900 words to work with.</em></p>

<p><em>In this longer blog post, I wanted to give more context for what Iâ€™m saying, especially because the Pew report is pretty good work, with the definitional exception. Here I want to explain a bit about <strong>why</strong> Pew researchers can say â€œalternative social mediaâ€ and only refer to exerable sites like Gab and Parler.</em></p>

<p><em>This post will also be the skeleton for some upcoming talks Iâ€™m going to give, one at the Association of Internet Researchers and another at MalmÃ¶ University.</em></p>
