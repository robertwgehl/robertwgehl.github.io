I"â<p>I just read a new article focusing on Mastodon: Christina Dunbar-Hesterâ€™s â€œ<a href="https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/13367/11436">Showing Your Ass on Mastodon</a>.â€ (Iâ€™ve put in <a href="/bib.html">the bibliography</a>, too). It has inspired a blog post!</p>

<p>Dunbar-Hesterâ€™s article discusses a controversy â€“ and a harassment campaign â€“ centering on the #asstodon hashtag on the fediverse. She created (or co-created) that hashtag in late 2022, not long after the large wave of people joined Mastodon due to Muskâ€™s purchase of Twitter. The #asstodon hashtag was created to inject a bit of levity into the network: it was used predominantly to share pictures of donkeys. However, because of the double-meaning, there was at least one buttshot included in the mix.</p>

<p>In this paper, which is a kind of accidental autoethnography, Dunbar-Hester discusses how one donkeyposter become irate over the presence of human butts instead of donkeys in #asstodon posts. The donkeyposter eventually began harassing people â€“ including Dunbar-Hester, using multiple accounts, posting racist content, and even emailing Dunbar-Hester at her work.</p>

<p>In researching donkeyposterâ€™s actions, Dunbar-Hester argues that the structure of Mastodon may not be amenable to hashtag activism.</p>

<p>I should note the article has a delightful amount of butt puns! I only managed one in this post (see if you can find it).</p>

<p>I want to draw on Dunbar-Hesterâ€™s article to write about something Iâ€™ve been wrestling with: methodologies for studying the fediverse. Specifically, I want to highlight a distinction between Dunbar-Hesterâ€™s approach and the one Iâ€™ve chosen for my <a href="/2024/02/11/Move-Slowy-Preview.html">book project</a>. This is not to say Dunbar-Hester did it wrong â€“ in fact, her paper is excellent, and as fediverse scholarship grows, we will need multiple studies and many perspectives. I will highlight my instance-centric approach as a contrast.</p>
