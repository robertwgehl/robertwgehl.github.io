I"Š<p>This weekâ€™s FOSS finds: Iâ€™m starting to look back at the early days of ActivityPub, and chat apps get some coverage. So once again, donâ€™t count on these posts as a news feed, but more a window into my thinking as I research my FOSS alternative social media book.</p>

<p>This is the press release from the W3C announcing the start of the Social Web Working Group, which I understand gave us ActivityPub, the protocol that supports contemporary federated social media systems such as Mastodon.</p>

<p>This somewhat innocuous-looking site is the start of something big â€“ the transcript first meeting of the Social Web Working Group, held over IRC. What immediately catches my eye is the forceful statement from Tantek Ã‡elik, of Mozilla: â€œwe donâ€™t want to see a big company or 2-3 get a monopolistic control in this space.â€ Thinking about that from the outset likely affected the ultimate design.</p>

<p>This is essentially a press release from RocketChat and published on Opensource.com. What caught my eye is that this system appears to be federated. Iâ€™m getting more curious about federated chat applications â€“ it feels like a very active area of development, and yet chat feels so <em>old</em> â€“ how long as XMPP been around? So itâ€™s interesting to me that chat apps are cropping up in my news feeds.</p>

<p>Case in point. Hereâ€™s another chat app, Delta Chat. This one is intriguing. The author mentions Mattermost, Signal, and RocketChat and then points to the major differentiating feature of Delta Chat: it uses <em>encrypted emails</em> to send the messages. So the backend is email, while the frontend appears to be chat application. Itâ€™s so crazy it just might work.</p>
