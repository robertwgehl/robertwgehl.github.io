I"ˆ<p>About a week ago, I took to my home Mastodon instance, scholar.social, and asked whether people preferred <a href="https://www.zettlr.com/">Zettlr</a> or <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>. Both are Markdown editors which also provide valuable features on top, including linking together Markdown notes and varying degrees of Zotero support.</p>

<p>I asked because Iâ€™m using Markdown more and more. I use it regularly to plan my weeks, I obviously use it for this blog (which is a static Jekyll site), and I started using it to jot down ideas in a journaling program called <a href="https://rednotebook.sourceforge.io/">RedNoteBook</a>. I was hoping to streamline blogging, note-taking, and other Markdown tasks in one system.</p>

<p>So, I have tried both Zettlr and Obsidian â€“ and I also tried a third system, <a href="https://logseq.com/">Logseq</a> â€“ and have decided to adopt Zettlr. It meets my needs quite well, which are probably a bit more minimal than people might expect.</p>

<p>However, given what these projects are doing, I do not feel locked into my choice. In fact, I have all three installed and may hop between them.</p>
