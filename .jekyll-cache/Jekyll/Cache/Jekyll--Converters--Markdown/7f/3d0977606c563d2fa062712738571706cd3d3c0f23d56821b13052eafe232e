I"Ş<p>Nobre et alâ€™s â€œMore of the Same? A Study of Images Shared on Mastodonâ€™s Federated Timelineâ€ is a <a href="10.1007/978-3-031-19097-1_11">paper that is now published</a> in proceedings from <em>International Conference on Social Informatics.</em> (Unfortunately, itâ€™s not open access.)</p>

<p>Because Iâ€™m currently researching the fediverse and blogging about that process, I thought Iâ€™d write up notes on this paper. Why this paper? Frankly, because Iâ€™m pretty certain it violates the community norms, as well as terms of service, of many Mastodon instances. It instantly reminded me of the controversial paper from Zignani et al, <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/3262/3130">â€œMastodon Content Warnings: Inappropriate Contents on a Microblogging Platformâ€</a>, which resulted in a <a href="https://www.sunclipse.org/wp-content/downloads/2020/01/open-letter.html">scathing open letter</a> and the retraction of a dataset from the <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/R1HKVS">Harvard Dataverse</a>.</p>

<p>Nobre et alâ€™s â€œMore of the Sameâ€ is a study of image-sharing. The authors claim that it is about image-sharing on Mastodon, but really their focus is on images they culled from Mastodon.socialâ€™s federated timeline. They pulled 4M posts from 103K active users, of which 1M had images. Since they pulled posts from Mastodon.socialâ€™s federated timeline, they saw posts from 4K separate instances. The authors state that a â€œrelevant numberâ€ of the images they found are â€œexplicit.â€ They categorize the images as such after running them through Googleâ€™s <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision">Vision AI</a> Safe Search system. They also run the images they find through Googleâ€™s image search to trace where the images came from and how they are shared on Mastodon. Ultimately, the authors donâ€™t really make an argument, other than stating in passing that Mastodon needs better moderation, since people share explicit images.</p>

<p>In some ways, â€œMore of the Sameâ€ lives up to its title: itâ€™s more of the same poor scholarship that can be seen in Zignani et al (in fact, Nobre et al cite that controversial paper). Here are my critiques:</p>
