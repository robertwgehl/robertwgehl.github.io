I"{<p>I’ve not posted for a while. And that’s ok. Why? Because we all need a break. A vacation.</p>

<p>You. You there. You should take a break.</p>

<p>I did. It’s ok. The work will be there later.</p>

<p>While traveling with family and seeing my friends, I once again relied heavily on a device I begrudgingly have: a mobile phone, in this case a Google Android device. While I work really hard to avoid apps or limit their permissions, I just <em>don’t like</em> having Google anything in my pocket.</p>

<p>And while I have a <a href="https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/">PinePhone</a> Braveheart edition, it’s just not ready to be my main phone.</p>

<p>So, in the interim, I’m doing something I should have done a while ago: trying out <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/">F-Droid</a>, the FOSS collection of Android apps.</p>

<p>I was inspired in part by an interview I had with <a href="https://twitter.com/felimwhiteley">Félim Whiteley</a> of the <a href="https://latenightlinux.com/">Late Night Linux</a> podcast. Whiteley is a well-known de-Googler. The interview will be used as a part of the research for a forthcoming <a href="https://thereboot.com">Reboot</a> article I’m working on.</p>

<p>So I guess the vacation wasn’t all vacation, because I found myself mucking about with FOSS, once again. This time on my phone. But, hey, that’s the FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream for you. I can’t turn it off easily.</p>

<p>More posts soon!</p>
