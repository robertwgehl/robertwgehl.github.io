I"ü<p><em>EDIT: Credit where credit is due: I stole many of these ideas from <a href="https://seanlawson.net">Sean Lawson</a>. Except they are better with FOSS.</em></p>

<p>The year 2020. Damn. Damn, damn, damn, damn.</p>

<p>Put it in the dumpster, man.</p>

<p>But the end of the worst year ever is also the end of the 2010s, so maybe nowâ€™s a good time to reflect on my past decade as a FOSS Academic. As I mentioned in the <a href="/2020/11/27/introduction.html">Introduction</a>, Iâ€™ve been using FOSS tools to do my job as a university professor for over a decade. Now, Iâ€™m looking ahead to the next decade.</p>

<p>Here, I want to document my workflow. Itâ€™s a combination of desktop environments, workspace management, weekly planning and long-term goals. Iâ€™ve been developing it over the past decade, and I think itâ€™s time I formally document just how I do what I do.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a longish post, but then again, <a href="https://youtu.be/K9ZQhyOZCNE?t=486">weâ€™re talking about practice</a>. That gets complex!</p>
