<p>Please don‚Äôt tell me to use Okular.</p>

<p>Please don‚Äôt tell me to use LaTex.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm barely keeping things together using Atril and pdfunite in the command line.</p>

<p>I popped over to <a href="https://itsfoss.com/pdf-editors-linux/">It‚Äôs FOSS</a> to see their list of top applications. When your list starts with LibreOffice Draw‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what to say. It gets worse from there, going to a bunch of commercial, proprietary solutions.</p>

<p>At this point, feel free to tell me to switch to Windows.</p>
