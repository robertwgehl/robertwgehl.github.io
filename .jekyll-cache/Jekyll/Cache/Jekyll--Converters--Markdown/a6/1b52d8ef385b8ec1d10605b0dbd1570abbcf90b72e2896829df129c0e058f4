I"(<p>I’ve previously posted about <a href="2020/12/01/Zotero-Tips-and-Tricks.html">Zotero “tips and tricks,”</a> I have a <a href="2021/04/02/ZoteroComments.html">brief review of the beta version of Zotero’s PDF system</a>, and I have an overview of <a href="2020/12/27/Workflow.html">my workflow in Linux</a>, but here I want to do a deep dive into how I conduct note-taking in Zotero. I imagine this can be part of a series where I talk about how Zotero notes flow into Zettlr and from there into drafting out ideas in Libreoffice Writer.</p>
