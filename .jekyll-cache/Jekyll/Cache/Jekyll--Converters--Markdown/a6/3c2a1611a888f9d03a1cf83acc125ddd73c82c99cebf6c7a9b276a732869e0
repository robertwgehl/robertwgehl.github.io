I"Â<p>This is just a short note to announce that, thanks to some generous funding at York University, I am recruiting graduate students (MA and PhD) as well as post-docs. Iâ€™d like to work with folks on alternative social media, in particular. Methodologically, I tend to use qualitative approaches, such as digital ethnography, software studies, and grounded theory/situational analysis. I am a critical scholar, as well, so I prefer working with people who are actively examining power relations in technical systems.</p>

<p>Grad students, York has two programs Iâ€™m affiliated with: <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/gradstudies/sts/">Science and Technology Studies</a> and <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/gradstudies/cmct/">Communication and Culture</a>, a communication and media studies focused program. My understanding is that STS in particular is eager for students, so if you have any background in STS, I would recommend that route. Either way, please do contact me via email (I have a protonmail account, robertwgehl) or <a href="https://aoir.social/@rwg">find me on the fediverse</a>.</p>

<p>Post-docs, York U has received a very generous grant called <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/research/connected-minds/opportunities/">Connected Minds</a> which includes many funding opportunities. Contact me if you have some interest there.</p>
