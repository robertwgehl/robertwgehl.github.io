I"<p>A quick note to any readers in GDPR regulated areas: I’m in the USA, and I don’t really do business in Europe. I don’t really do business anywhere, to be honest. Anyway, I also really respect privacy concerns. So, in the interest of transparency, I want to note that I use a <a href="https://www.statcounter.com">Statcounter</a> script to help track traffic to this blog.</p>

<p>You can see the Javascript in the page source for the blog, and I’ve also <a href="https://statcounter.com/p5832197/summary/?account_id=1462290&amp;login_id=3&amp;code=6a0a1540cdf3119c0be6e16464d0d1fe&amp;guest_login=1">made the stats public</a> (marvel at my traffic!).</p>

<p><del>If you block Javascript, I not only don’t mind, nothing should change for you. The site will function just fine with Javascript blocked.</del></p>

<p>Edit on March 20: Oops! I forgot about Javascript from Heroku, enabling <a href="https://staticman.net/">Staticman comments</a>. I was reminded of this when I got a comment from a reader. If you block Javascript, you may have trouble commenting on posts.</p>

<p>My call is still out: if you have a better way to get basic traffic data for a Github.io-hosted static Jekyll blog, let me know in the comments or via Mastodon (@robertwgehl@scholar.social).</p>
