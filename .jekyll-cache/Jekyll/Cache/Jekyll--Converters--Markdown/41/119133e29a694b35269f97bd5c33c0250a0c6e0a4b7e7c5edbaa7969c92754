I" <p>Elon, what are you doing? I donâ€™t know. None of us knows.</p>

<p>But it appears youâ€™re tearing Twitter apart. And this is driving people to Mastodon. I will talk about Mastodon at some other point â€“ I am, of course, writing a book about it.</p>

<p>Here, I want to talk about the fall of Twitter and what I think it means.</p>

<p>The TL;DR version is: I donâ€™t think Twitter was all that important.</p>
