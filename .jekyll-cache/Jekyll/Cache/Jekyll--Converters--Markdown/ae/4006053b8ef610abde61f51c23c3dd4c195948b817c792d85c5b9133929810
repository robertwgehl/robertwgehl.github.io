I"∑<p>One major goal for my Goal 2 book project is to learn from people who create things on the fediverse. They might create code and cultures by developing and running instances. Or, they might be using the fediverse to promote their <a href="https://pixelfed.social/">photography</a>, <a href="https://funkwhale.audio/">music</a>, or <a href="https://writefreely.org/">ideas</a>.</p>

<p>As an endowed research chair, I have the privilege of <a href="http://www.regents.la.gov/assets/docs/2013/05/BoRSF_Endowed_Prof_Policy_Rev_10-12.pdf">generous research funding</a>. For the purposes of my book project, research includes talking to people, running my own digital infrastructure (e.g., the incredible Nextcloud), and, of course, studying texts.</p>

<p>The meaning of ‚Äútexts‚Äù is quite open-ended. Obviously, I‚Äôm reading books and journal articles. But so, so much knowledge is being created on the Fediverse itself ‚Äì including knowledge offered only to subscribers. There are artists, musicians, and writers using Patreon (or, maybe better, <a href="https://liberapay.com/">Liberapay</a>) to share their work with subscribers.</p>

<p>Do the math, Robert.</p>
