I"./<p>The year 2020. Damn. Damn, damn, damn, damn.</p>

<p>Put it in the dumpster, man.</p>

<p>But the end of the worst year ever is also the end of the 2010s, so maybe now’s a good time to reflect on my past decade as a FOSS Academic. As I mentioned in the <a href="/2020/11/27/introduction.html">Introduction</a>, I’ve been using FOSS tools to do my job as a university professor for over a decade. Now, I’m looking ahead to the next decade.</p>

<p>Here, I want to document my workflow. It’s a combination of desktop environments, workspace management, weekly planning and long-term goals. I’ve been developing it over the past decade, and I think it’s time I formally document just how I do what I do.</p>

<p>It’s a longish post, but then again, <a href="https://youtu.be/K9ZQhyOZCNE?t=486">we’re talking about practice</a>. That gets complex!</p>

<h2 id="workspaces">Workspaces</h2>

<p>No matter the underlying distro, I use the MATE desktop environment, which has a handy workplace switcher applet. This is fine, but out of the box is missing something.</p>

<p>Enter Devil’s Pie. It’s not just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgvE6c7-2ag">a documentary about the R&amp;B singer D’Angelo</a>. Devilspie is a <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Devilspie">small application</a> that gives me total control over how applications load into various workspaces.</p>

<p>On my typical MATE setup, I have 6 workspaces. I’m old-school, so I set them up horizontally in a top panel. I also set my keyboard shortcut to CTRL+Left or Right to switch between them.</p>

<p>One of the first things I do is install devilspie and set it to run on startup.</p>

<p>Devilspie works with scripts stored in ~/USER/.devilspie. Each application requires its own script (saved in .ds files). For example, my Firefox script is:</p>

<pre>
(if (is (application_name) "Firefox") (set_workspace 3))
</pre>

<p>That line is in a file called firefox.ds, and as you might have guessed, opens Firefox in Workspace 3. Now, no matter where I open Firefox, it gets pinned to workspace 3, and is at most a couple CTRL+direction keystrokes away.</p>

<p>Using similar techniques, I route my applications to the same places – Zotero, the citation manager, goes in Workspace 1. My “comms” workspace is 5, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Evolution">Evolution</a> email and chat applications routed there. Entertainment (music players, video players) goes to 6. Terminals and my IDE (currently Brackets) goes to 4.</p>

<p>With the exception of Brackets going to 4, most of my writing goes into Workspace 2. I route Libreoffice there, as well as my PDF reader. I also use some rules to move Zotero notes to Workspace 2. Devilspie allows me to control window geometry, so I set my PDF reader to 2/3s of the screen and a Zotero note to the remaining 1/3. Devilspie even supports <a href="https://itsfoss.com/always-on-top/">“always on top”</a>, though I don’t use that much.</p>

<p>I’m a bit concerned, however. The original devilspie is <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/DevilsPie">apparently no longer being maintained</a>, and neither is its successor, <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/devilspie2/">Devilspie2</a>. I hope these handy applications stick around!</p>

<p>But for now, with devilspie and the corresponding rules in place, when I launch an application (in my case, using <a href="https://www.fossmint.com/synapse-application-launcher-and-file-search-tool/">Synapse</a>, which appears with CTRL+Space), I know exactly which workspace it’s routed to. I can flip between a browser and a writing application with a keystroke – cutting, pasting, and so on.</p>

<h2 id="pomodoro">Pomodoro</h2>
<p>In fact, switching from my writing space Workspace 2 to email or a Signal message in Workspace 5 is now <em>too</em> easy. Distraction is just a couple CTRL+Rights away. I find myself flipping over to email too often, and for no good reason. Because of this, I close Evolution and Signal, but to really help me focus, I also use the <a href="https://gnomepomodoro.org/">Pomodoro Timer for Gnome</a>.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/pomodoro.png" alt="The Pomodoro for GNOME timer" title="The Pomodoro for GNOME timer" />
    <figcaption>The Pomodoro Timer in action.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I find the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro Technique</a> to be a simple and effective way to stay on task. It starts with a conscious decision to say “I am working on this task.” Then, I start the timer (set to the default 25 minutes) and do it. After 25 minutes, the Pomodoro Timer takes over my screen and says, “Take a break!” I take the 5 minute break to stretch, do some pushups, move my limbs. And then: back at it for another 25. If I do four Pomodoros, I take a longer, 15 minute break, usually by walking around campus.</p>

<p>The nice thing about this approach is that it is open-ended. If I have a stack of emails: that’s the task. Once that’s done, I can switch to grading, or writing. 25 minutes seems like a good amount to knock out a lot of things.</p>

<p>But how to decide which tasks need be done?</p>

<h2 id="cal-newports-weekly-to-do-list-workspace-5">Cal Newport’s Weekly To-do List: Workspace 5</h2>

<p>I don’t think Cal Newport came up with the <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2014/08/08/deep-habits-plan-your-week-in-advance/">weekly work plan</a>, but I give him credit because I first learned it from his blog. As he writes,</p>

<blockquote>
    On Monday mornings I plan the upcoming work week. I capture this plan in an e-mail and send it to myself so that I will be sure to see it and have access to it daily.
</blockquote>

<p>I used to do it via email, but now I put a task in Evolution. Every Monday morning, I spend about an hour assessing what I need to get done in the week, and then I develop a weekly schedule with time blocks allotted to the various tasks. I set the task to be “due” on Sunday. I don’t actually look at it then; I instead look back on last week’s plan on the subsequent Monday morning, reflecting on what I got done in the previous week. I also use the Sunday deadline to see if any tasks in Evolution are due <em>sooner</em> than my weekly schedule – that means those tasks are high priority for the week.</p>

<p>At the top of my weekly plan I list out projects I’m working on. Usually, these are long-term projects which require daily work to maintain progress towards deadlines.</p>

<p>I then break the week down by day and assign blocks of time (typically an hour or two) as time to drive towards completing those long-term goals.</p>

<p>A week then looks like this:</p>

</pre>

<p>You’ll notice I’m following Newport’s advice to keep it flexible. Not every moment of the week is planned, but I do allot a good amount of time to “deep” tasks like writing. (And if you’re thinking that this will work well with Pomodoro – you’re right!). For me, I can do about 2 hours of intense writing a working day, so that’s all I schedule.</p>

<p>Speaking of flexibility, I also like having at least 2 writing projects at a time – I agree with <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/how-to-find-a-writing-routine-that-works">Manya Whitaker’s suggestion to have a couple projects</a> in order to switch from one when I inevitably get sick of it. (There is nothing better for writing, I find, then putting what I’ve written away for a while and coming back to it later.)</p>

<p>The rest of my day I tackle other tasks – “urgent” emails, grading, course prep.</p>

<h2 id="writing-routine-workspace-2">Writing Routine: Workspace 2</h2>

<p>As you can tell, my work centers on writing. I do most of my work in Workspace 2. So let me say a bit more about that.</p>

<p>The biggest thing I do is “pay myself first” – that is, whenever possible, I write first. If I have an early class, of course, I get ready to teach that, but my drive is always “write first” in a given day. Writing journal articles or books is a long-term practice that can feel like there’s no immediate payoff. That’s a danger, because knocking out 25 emails or grading 25 papers has an immediate payoff. The problem is that I have finite energy, and I spend a few hours on grading or emails, I will not be in the mood to do any deep writing. So, writing comes first.</p>

<p>Related to this: because answering an email has that immediate payoff (yay! another email answered!) and writing can feel like a long slog, I give myself credit for my daily writing. I keep a log of how many words I write in a day (a habit I think I picked up after <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03/02/john-steinbeck-working-days/">reading about John Steinbeck’s habits</a>). I have a daily goal of 500 words a day. I can usually do that in two hours. I keep a log of these words in a LibreOffice spreadsheet, and I monitor my writing goals on a fortnightly basis.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/writingspreadsheet.png" alt="A portion of my writing spreadsheet" title="A portion of my writing spreadsheet" />
    <figcaption>A portion of my writing spreadsheet. Notes, writing, and revision included.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You may ask: 500 words a day? What if they suck? Aren’t you just setting yourself up to just write 500 bad words to fulfill some arbitrary goal?</p>

<p>Well… maybe. But – and I can’t emphasize this enough – <strong>you don’t know if the words are any good until you write them.</strong> They have to exist to be judged. By keeping track of my daily writing, I’ve learned over the years that probably 1/10th of my writing ends up actually getting published. The rest ends up on the proverbial “cutting room floor.” But I don’t get to publish the 10% if I don’t write anything in the first place.</p>

<p>In other words: I don’t believe in inspiration. Practice. Yes, AI, I’m talking about practice.</p>

<p>You may also ask: what about taking notes? I consider that writing, so it counts (though I usually count half of my note-taking words). Taking notes is definitely writing – reading a journal article or book sparks ideas, and of course I must cite and build upon sources. So that counts, too.</p>

<p>You may finally ask: what about revision? Surely you <em>cut</em> words. Do you count them as negative word counts?</p>

<p>No. If I’m revising, I give myself credit for hours I spend doing that. Revision is so important that it gets its own column in my spreadsheet.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So, there you have it. My workflow using FOSS tools – MATE Desktop, devilspie, Evolution, Zotero, Libreoffice. Weekly plans, long-term projects, and daily writing goals.</p>

<p>It’s worked quite well for me over the 2010s. I’ve <a href="https://bookshop.org/contributors/robert-w-gehl">written three books</a>, a couple dozen journal articles, and a range of other publications, all while teaching courses and doing service.</p>

<p>So, I think it will work well into the 2020s. I think I can use this process to drive towards <strong>Goal 2</strong>: my next book. A FOSS book.</p>
