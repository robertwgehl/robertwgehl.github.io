I"F<p>This week’s FOSS finds: I was listening to NPR (which makes sense since I drive an electric car) and StoryCorps came on. I usually hear it while dropping my kid off at school, and it’s always a conversation-starter between us. It has been for years. Which got me to thinking: the StoryCorps project must have <em>a lot</em> of archived recordings of their oral history.</p>

<p>Indeed, they do.</p>

<p>Which got me to thinking: if StoryCorps has been around for 20 years, they must have done an interview or two about FOSS.</p>

<p>Indeed, they have.</p>

<p>So the FOSS find this time are a few citations of those interviews. I haven’t had a chance to listen to them yet, so these abstracts will be from the StoryCorps site. I will listen to them soon, because I wonder if they can supplement my Goal 2 book project research. I’m <a href="/2022/04/17/InterviewWorkflow.html">conducting interviews of my own</a>, but the more voices, the better, yeah?
