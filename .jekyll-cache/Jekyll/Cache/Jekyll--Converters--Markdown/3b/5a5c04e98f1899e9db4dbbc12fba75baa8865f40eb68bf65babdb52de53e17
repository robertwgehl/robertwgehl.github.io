I"ý<p>Zotero recently announced two major new features: an internal PDF reader and tab-based navigation. These are scheduled to be a part of the Zotero 6 release later this year, but when I heard about them, <a href="/2021/03/19/cuttingZotero.html">I installed the Zotero 5 developer version</a> to give them a whirl.</p>

<p>My quick take on the new features? They are now a key part of the FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream.</p>
