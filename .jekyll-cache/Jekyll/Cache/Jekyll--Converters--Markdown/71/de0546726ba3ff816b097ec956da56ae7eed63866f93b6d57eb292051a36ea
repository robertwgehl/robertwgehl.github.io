I"<p>I recently announced my <a href="2022/01/06/Goal2.html">new book project</a>, focusing on ethical FOSS social media, and I’m trying an experiment in writing it openly. That’s Goal 2 of this blog (Goal 1 being discussions of my actually using FOSS to complete this task). To that end, I’ve decided to share items I’ve found as I do my research.</p>

<p>I’m calling it FOSS Finds, because alliteration.</p>

<p>These are typically going to be websites, blogposts, podcasts, or academic research. They may or may not be very recent. I plan on including a citation (expored, of course, from Zotero) and a brief note about each, a la an annotated bibliography, and versions of my Zotero tags. The notes won’t be exhaustive – it’s really about what I’m collecting at this stage, rather than analysis.</p>
