I"ª<p>Big news on the search front! The Brave Browser is now <a href="https://search.brave.com/">offering a search engine</a>. According to <a href="https://brave.com/brave-search-beta/">their announcment</a>, Brave Search promises â€œindependent option for search which gives them unmatched privacyâ€ and will use an independent index, rather than rely on Google or Microsoft. Iâ€™ve already started playing with Brave Search and am curious to see how it develops.</p>

<p>However, any time someone offers a search engine and their corporate parent isnâ€™t named Alphbet, thereâ€™s a pretty predictable reaction: â€œGood on them for trying, but you just canâ€™t beat Google.â€  Iâ€™ve also heard academics say the same thing: â€œI canâ€™t find anything without Google.â€</p>

<p>Search is, of course, a very common approach to conducting research, and itâ€™s especially important to my work on Internet cultures. One key way to study the Internet is by searching it. And it seems as though that means all my work ought to flow through Google.</p>

<p>I hadnâ€™t really thought much about this situation until just recently. Along with Sean Lawson, I co-authored a book, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/social-engineering"><em>Social Engineering: How Crowdmasters, Phreaks, Hackers, and Trolls Created a New Form of Manipulative Communication</em></a>. It will come out from MIT Press in a few months.</p>

<p>The book is the result of four years of research on hacker social engineering practices as well as early 20th century propaganda and public relations (a field that also referred to its activity as â€œsocial engineeringâ€). After finishing this latest book, I realized Iâ€™m a living testament to the fact that yes, you can de-Google your search and still conduct research. Because thatâ€™s what I did.</p>
