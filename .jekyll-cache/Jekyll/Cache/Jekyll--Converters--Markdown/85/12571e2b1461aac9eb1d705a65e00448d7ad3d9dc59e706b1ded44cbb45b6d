I"	<p><a href="https://linuxunplugged.com/">Linux Unplugged</a> is at it again: it’s Tuxies time! I voted, and <a href="https://tuxies.party">you can, too</a>. Unlike last year, this year they’re using a self-hosted Nextcloud form – brilliant! Like <a href="2020/12/10/The-Tuxies-Academic-Style.html">last year</a>, I’ve voted based on my experience as a FOSS Academic. My picks may not win – but they might just help you live the FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream.</p>

<h2 id="best-newcomerbecame-well-known">Best Newcomer/Became Well Known</h2>
<p>I’m going to keep pounding a drum few of us will hear, but <strong>Zotero</strong> needs to be known about. Zotero, which is a bibliographic management system, released a beta of a new PDF reader and annotator which has greatly improved how I do academic research.</p>

<h2 id="text-editor">Text Editor</h2>
<p><strong>Nano.</strong> It just gets things done.</p>

<h2 id="distro-of-the-year">Distro of the Year</h2>
<p><strong>Manjaro.</strong> I predict Fedora’s going to win because it was constantly discussed on Linux Unplugged and I suspect the listenership will go with it. But I switched my main work laptop from Debian-based distros to Manjaro this year and have been so impressed. I didn’t realize what a relief it is not to have to worry about doing a massive upgrade – just keep rolling along instead.</p>

<h2 id="server">Server</h2>
<p>I use Ubuntu LTS for stability, so I probably have no business making this call. But I have been impressed by the organizational structure of <strong>AlmaLinux.</strong> Every time I hear one of their representatives speak on podcasts, I can just hear their unwavering commitment to creating a community-owned enterprise Linux server distro. In fact, I think I need to study their structure a bit further.</p>

<h2 id="desktop-environment">Desktop Environment</h2>
<p>This one won’t win, but I love <strong>MATE</strong> and will defend it with chrysknives. I’ve said it before, but when it comes to desktops, I’m a Linux Luddite.</p>

<h2 id="largest-impact">Largest impact</h2>
<p>I suspect Pipewire will win, but I think <strong>Wireguard</strong> has been brilliant. I’ve used it extensively to create a virtual private network of devices, including Android phones, all using an installation of Pi-Hole to block unwanted traffic. A big, big benefit I’ve seen is countering some bad practices from my ISP: if I listen to internet radio streams on my regular connection, they are dropped after a few minutes. Run them through Wireguard and the streams will flow for days.</p>

<h2 id="self-hosted-service">Self-hosted service</h2>
<p><strong>Pi-hole.</strong> Ad-blocking, local DNS, child-proofing my kid’s computer, blocking Facebook from my network… it’s all possible with Pi-Hole. Couple this with Wireguard and I can block ads on any connection, anywhere in the world.</p>
