I"-<p><em>NB: This is the first in a series of posts where I will share my notes on my readings of the minutes of the Social Web Working Group. Future posts to come.</em></p>

<p>As readers of the blog know by now, Goal 2 of the blog is <a href="/2022/01/06/Goal2.html">to document my writing of my next book</a>, which I‚Äôm tentatively titling <em>Move Slowly and Build Bridges: Mastodon and the Struggle for Ethical Alternative Social Media</em>.</p>

<p>To that end, I have been studying the workings of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Social/WG">Social Web Working Group</a> (SocialWG), a W3C standards group which ran from 2014 through 2017 and ultimately produced, among other things, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a>, the protocol that underpins much of the fediverse.</p>

<p>I figure I cannot tell any stories about Mastodon without understanding the production of ActivityPub. Looking through the SocialWG meetings, it‚Äôs quite clear that Mastodon and ActivityPub‚Äôs histories are deeply intertwined. Mastodon adopted ActivityPub it prior to AP being a Candidate Recommendation (the penultimate stage in the W3C recommendation process). Mastodon is also a key reason why the Social Web Working Group got a 6 month extension for their work in 2017 ‚Äì see <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/2017-06-27-minutes">this meeting</a>. They even set up a Mastodon instance (w3c.social) to show W3C members that software.</p>

<p>This post will discuss the early period of the SocialWG (circa 2014 through 2015). I‚Äôll follow up later with more posts and notes.</p>

<p>Importantly, I need to offer a couple caveats.</p>

<p>First, I didn‚Äôt participate in the group. Instead, I‚Äôm basing much of this off the meeting minutes, as well as blog posts by SocialWG members, and to a lesser extent on informal discussions and formal interviews with some of the members. It‚Äôs possible ‚Äì likely, even ‚Äì that I will get details wrong, not simply because I wasn‚Äôt there, but also because this poor English major was not trained in computer science. The notes here are things that caught my eye. If you have corrections or critiques of my interpretation, please do share in the comments! And, as I talk to more people, I might change my interpretations, as well.</p>

<p>Second, my focus is predominantly going to be on ActivityPub. However, the SocialWG produced quite a few other standards. That said, in focusing on the group‚Äôs history, I should cover a lot of ground, even with my emphasis on ActivityPub.</p>

<p>Third, the meeting minutes are not verbatim transcripts (which makes sense ‚Äì meeting minutes almost never are). They were taken by volunteers from among the SocialWG, who were trying to transcribe phone conversations while an IRC chat was going. So, any quotes I include here should not be taken as verbatim statements. In addition, given the sheer number of times I read statements such as ‚Äúwho‚Äôs speaking now?‚Äù and ‚ÄúI can hear weird noises‚Äù ‚Äì these were largely telephone conferences, after all ‚Äì I would take any attributions here with a major grain of salt, as well. Take, for example, the following exchange from <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/2015-02-17-minutes">this meeting</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>harry: so a cheapo understanding of heirarchy</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Ä¶ am confused when I read the spec</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>scribe: was that harry or dret¬†?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>sorry if I set the wrong one</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>dret: me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice in this example statements are attributed to harry when they were actually said by dret. So, I will tend to cite statements and ideas with minimal attribution unless I am 99% certain the statement can be attributed to the person.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs dive in!</p>
