I"<p>I‚Äôve previously posted about <a href="2020/12/01/Zotero-Tips-and-Tricks.html">Zotero ‚Äútips and tricks,‚Äù</a> I have a <a href="2021/04/02/ZoteroComments.html">brief review of the beta version of Zotero‚Äôs PDF system</a>, and I have an overview of <a href="2020/12/27/Workflow.html">my workflow in Linux</a>, but here I want to do a deep dive into how I conduct note-taking in Zotero. I imagine this can be part of a series where I talk about how Zotero notes flow into Zettlr and from there into drafting out ideas in Libreoffice Writer.</p>

<p>Here, I will offer a two-for-one post: I‚Äôll use my annotations of Derek Caelin‚Äôs <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-79072-1_8">excellent book chapter on fediverse moderation</a> as examples.</p>

<h1 id="colors">Colors</h1>
<p>I think the most consistent thing I‚Äôve done over my nearly 15 years (what?!?) of using Zotero is taking advantage of the highlighting color palette. Originally, this was limited to Zotero‚Äôs notes, but now is part of the PDF annotation.</p>

<p>Currently, Zotero offers a 5-color palette (yellow, red, green, blue, and purple). As I read a PDF in Zotero‚Äôs reader, I highlight passages according to this scheme:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Yellow are good quotes or things to pay attention to.</li>
  <li>Red is similar, except ‚Äúhotter,‚Äù so to speak. If yellow means ‚Äúthis is important,‚Äù red means ‚Äúthis is <em>really</em> important.‚Äù</li>
  <li>Green are definitions. When authors define their terms, it gets greened.</li>
  <li>Purple are meta comments from the author about the paper. Things like, ‚ÄúIn this article, I argue that‚Ä¶‚Äù and ‚ÄúUsing a methdology of‚Ä¶‚Äù</li>
</ul>

  <figcaption>Excellent point! That's a quotable quote.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Anything I highlight in the Zotero PDF reader can be easily added to a corresponding note. These can also be sorted/highlighted in the Zotero PDF annotator, so it‚Äôs easy to spot Green (definitions) or Red (‚Äúhot‚Äù quotes).</p>

<h2 id="what-about-blue">What about Blue?</h2>
<p>You might notice Blue is missing. This is because I reserve for notes to myself. Whenever I take notes on someone‚Äôs work, I might put in a comment to myself, such as a connection to another article or an idea I have about how things fit together. Because of this, I don‚Äôt really use it in the PDF, but I do use it in my own notes.</p>

  <figcaption>This is a blue note. No, not the cool jazz, but a connection I am drawing.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>What I do put in the PDF reader is comments on the highlighted portions. These eventually become Blue highlighted sections of the corresponding note. I also put these comments in brackets and italicize them, so it‚Äôs very clear these are my own musings.</p>

<h1 id="tagging">Tagging</h1>
<p>As I mention in the <a href="2020/12/01/Zotero-Tips-and-Tricks.html">Tips and Tricks</a> post, I make extensive use of tagging. Zotero‚Äôs new PDF annotation system extends tagging into the PDF itself. Each of the highlighted portions can be tagged, and those tags are now searchable in the main Zotero window. This is awesome!</p>

<p>In addition, tags can also be selected in the PDF annotator. Also, quite awesome!</p>

<h1 id="from-individual-notes-to-synthesized-documents">From individual notes to synthesized documents</h1>
<p>You might notice that all this work is based on a one-to-one, note-to-PDF system. And of course, writing is about synthesizing ideas from across many sources. A weakness of my system is synthesis. However, I will address that step in another post ‚Äì and it will focus on Zettlr.</p>
