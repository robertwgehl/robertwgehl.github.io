I"u<p>I don’t often do “Year in Review” posts, but… this past year has been something else. I’ve started a new job in a new country, I published another book, and my area of research (alternative social media) got a lot of media attention. In addition, I’ve formulated a new book project – and in doing so, I almost regret the name of this blog! But don’t worry: the <a href="/2020/11/27/introduction.html">FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream</a> is still alive, even if it is a bit more self-reflexive about about FOSS means.</p>

<p>I’ll do this post in roughly chronological order. Buckle up: it’s a long one.</p>
