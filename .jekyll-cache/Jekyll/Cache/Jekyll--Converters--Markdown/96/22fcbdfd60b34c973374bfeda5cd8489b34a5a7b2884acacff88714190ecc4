I"³	<p>Ok, you all probably remember last fall, when the Muskening happened. When Mastodon saw a massive influx of new members. When Mastodon admins were struggling to keep up with the influx but ultimately showed that the network can, in fact, scale up. It was, in my view, the biggest stress on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a> protocol â€“ and ActivityPub kicked ass. Millions of people signed up for Mastodon.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s the titular Mastodon â€œbump.â€</p>

<p>Since Iâ€™ve published academic articles on Mastodon, during that Eternal Muskvember, I was approached by a lot of journalists (<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-users-mastodon-meltdown/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/ninetonoon/audio/2018866818/twitter-users-seek-alternative-to-musk-run-platform">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/shows/make-me-smart/unpacking-mastodon/">here</a>, for example) to talk about Mastodon, answering questions ranging from â€œwhat is it?â€ to â€œwill it replace Twitter?â€ It was an exciting and sometimes exasperating time. I basically told myself, â€œSelf, this sort of media attention is rare. Enjoy it, but know that it wonâ€™t last.â€ And indeed, a few weeks later, the story died down.</p>

<p>I also told myself to expect the inevitable follow-up. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m writing about here.</p>

<p>As many readers of this blog are likely aware, after the new year, Mastodonâ€™s active user base dropped off. As with every wave of social media movement from platform to platform, some percentage of people just donâ€™t stick with the new site.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s the titular Mastodon â€œslump.â€</p>

<p>Last week, I got an interview request from WIREDâ€™s Amanda Hoover, who was working on <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-mastodon-bump-is-now-a-slump/amp">a story</a> about how Mastodonâ€™s drop in active users signaled that it had failed in its mission to replace Twitter.</p>

<p>Now, before I go any further I will say Hooverâ€™s reporting on Mastodon has been excellent. She asks great questions, and she does more than just interview Eugen Rochko â€“ she talks to instance admins, lawyers, and academics like myself. And, in fact, the article Iâ€™m going to critique is quite good.</p>

<p>But I am going to use her latest WIRED article to illustrate an all-too-common trope in reporting on alternative social media: itâ€™s what I call â€œThe Killer Hype Cycle.â€</p>
