I"Ω<p>My first full-time academic job was at the University of Utah. Utah is, of course, very famous. No, not because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Pons">cold fusion</a> or teaching Ted Bundy about the law.</p>

<p>It is famous because it was the <a href="https://it.utah.edu/node4/posts/2017/august/node4-history.php">fourth node on the ARPAnet</a>, the forerunner to the modern internet. The other three nodes were in California; connecting to Utah was a major test of the network‚Äôs ability to work across long distances.</p>

<p>Although it was a US Defense Department-funded project, the ARPAnet was a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5432117">playground for academics</a> who took its mission (command-and-control even in spite of a nuclear attack) and turned it into research into networking and collaboration. The pattern continued: academic exploration of computer technologies has produced a bewildering array of experiments, and no doubt students at institutions have benefited greatly from being able to play with local, experimental computer tools while they study.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the early 2010s. I‚Äôm working at Utah, hired in part to teach a Web design class to Communication majors. Simple enough: each and every person affiliated with Utah had their own domain (something like domain.utah.edu/~username) on a local server, complete with FTP access via their email credentials. I taught students the basics of HTML and CSS. I got to see students who were openly scared of coding make things that appeared on their screens ‚Äì and on the internet. It was fun!</p>

<p>Until it was not. I was at Utah from 2010 to 2020. Over that time, it became harder and harder to get students into their web space. It turns out that Utah was winding down web hosting for everyone, centralizing its web presence and no longer providing web space to anyone. To support our class, the IT folks helpfully carved out some space on a server, specifically for our Comm Intro to the Web Design students, but we knew this was an exception.</p>

<p>At the end of my time there, even the machines in the computer lab were outsourced. Instead of fully-functional desktops, students were accessing their servers over a convoluted ‚Äúthin client‚Äù computer lab setup. I had to spend the first 2 weeks just showing them how to find their files ‚Äì since they were no longer local ‚Äì and then FTP into a server to move those files over a client-to-cloud-to-FTP setup. This was for students who had no networking or web design experience ‚Äì it was <em>rough</em>. (And if we needed software ‚Äì such as basic text editor ‚Äì good luck getting it when all the software was on a cloud somewhere).</p>

<p>I‚Äôm sorry to say I spent a great deal of that time in an increasingly adversarial relationship with the IT folks.</p>

<p>As this happened, my colleague <a href="https://seanlawson.net">Sean Lawson</a> and I would vent our frustration by jokingly saying, ‚ÄúWelcome to Node 4!‚Äù The irony being that Utah was once <em>25% of the freakin‚Äô Internet</em> but we could not get easy access to basic Web hosting. It was an ordeal just to get students to the point where they could move a text file they were working on to a server.</p>

<h2 id="someones-gotta-write-this-book">Someone‚Äôs Gotta Write This Book</h2>

<p>I would propose, were I to have time, to write a book called ‚ÄúHow Universities Lost the Internet.‚Äù How did we get from many nodes to everything being dumped into California or Redmond, WA?</p>

<p>I think there‚Äôs quite a readership for this book, judging from a recent thread on the fediverse. (Someone else can write it, though; I‚Äôm too busy with <a href="/2023/08/17/OxfordUP.html">my current project</a>!)</p>
