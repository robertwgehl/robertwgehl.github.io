I"‘<p>I am very excited to announce that my next book, <em>Move Slowly and Building Bridges: Mastodon, the Fediverse, and the Struggle for Democratic Social Media</em> will be published by Oxford University Press.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, I sent a proposal (a short synopsis of the book, audience considerations, and two sample chapters) to Oxford. They moved <em>fast</em>. They recruited two peer reviewers who turned around reviews very quickly, and then Oxfordâ€™s editorial board reviewed the project. I just received a contract based on these reviews.</p>

<p>The word I got from Oxford is that they are excited about the project â€“ and about the fediverse. Thatâ€™s really good news, because the normal advice an author would get is to promote oneâ€™s work on corporate social media. But I think that any book about the fediverse has to be talked about on the fediverse. Maybe this project can help other academic authors break away from Twitter/X and Facebook/Meta.</p>

<p>So, fediverse, watch for <a href="https://aoir.social/@rwg">posts about this book from me on Mastodon</a>. Iâ€™m also committing to sharing details about the book here on this blog.</p>
