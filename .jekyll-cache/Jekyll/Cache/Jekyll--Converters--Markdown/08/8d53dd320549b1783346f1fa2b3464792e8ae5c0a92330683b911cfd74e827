<p>Today, a lot of people have thoughts on Threads, which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/14/mastodon-founder-touts-threads-federation-saying-it-makes-his-x-rival-a-far-more-attractive-option/">actively testing ActivityPub federation</a>. The reactions range from triumphant proclamations about this making the fediverse more legitimate to abject horror that a company so reviled is attempting to join the fedi.</p>

<p>Full disclosure: Iâ€™m more in the latter camp.</p>

<p>As readers of this blog know, Iâ€™m working on a <a href="/2023/08/17/OxfordUP.html">book about the fediverse</a>, and part of my process is to share ideas out in the open. Since any book about the fediverse will have to talk about Threads, I figured this might be a good place to share a rough idea of how a chapter about Threads might go. Comments are welcome, of course!</p>

<p>Away we goâ€¦</p>
