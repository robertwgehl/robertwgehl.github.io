I"Ê<p>Just a short post to note I have succumbed to the dark side.</p>

<p>This whole pandemic has increased the amount of screen time we all endure, and Iâ€™ve increasingly recognized that dark modes feel better on my eyes. I started using the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/">Dark Reader</a> extension in Firefox to invert colors, and I set Mate to a dark theme on all my devices. After a few weeks of this, I realized that I liked the look of FOSS Academic when it was rendered using Dark Reader.</p>

<p>So, using the magic of <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> â€“ I am loving SASS! â€“ I changed a couple variables and BOOM! Weâ€™re doing FOSS after dark like were <a href="https://latenightlinux.com/">Joe, FÃ©lim, Graham, and Will</a>.</p>

<p>If you see any issues with the styling, let me know in the comments. I still have to style the comments â€“ Iâ€™ll get to it someday â€“ but in the meantime, enjoy the dark.</p>
