I"ç<p>For about a year Iâ€™ve been teasing at Goal 2 for this blog, which is to write a book about FOSS. Itâ€™s probably not surprising to hear that I needed to narrow that focus down. FOSS is a massive phenomenon, and any given area within it deserves lengthy analysis. For example, Biella Colemanâ€™s classic book <a href="https://www.powells.com/book/coding-freedom-the-ethics-aesthetics-of-hacking-9780691144610"><em>Coding Freedom</em></a> focuses heavily on the Debian distribution. One could imagine similar books about the Linux Kernel, or Canonical, or Arch, or web servers.</p>

<p>Given my background as a scholar, however, it makes sense that I should pursue a <strong>book-length project focusing on FOSS social media.</strong></p>
