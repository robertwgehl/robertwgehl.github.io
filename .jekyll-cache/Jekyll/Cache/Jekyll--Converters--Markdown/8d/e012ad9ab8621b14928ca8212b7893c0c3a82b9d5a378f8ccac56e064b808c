I"Å<p>Soâ€¦ itâ€™s coming together.</p>

<p>My current book, <em>Move Slowly and Build Bridges: Mastodon, the Fediverse, and the Struggle for Ethical Social Media</em> is mostly drafted! I am drafting a conclusion, but for now, I figured I would provide an overview of the book.</p>

<p>This post gives a chapter-by-chapter summary of the draft. Since itâ€™s a draft, things can still change, but as of today, Iâ€™m pretty pleased with the structure.</p>
