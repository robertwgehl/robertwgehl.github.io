I"¬<p>As part of Goal 2 of this blog, Iâ€™m writing a book about FOSS, specifically FOSS alternative social media. As like any good academic, I need to review the literature. I want to do so a bit more publicly than I have in the past â€“ hence this blog.</p>

<p>In fact, Iâ€™ve already started the process a bit: early on this blog went a bit viral <a href="2020/12/06/Dreaming-In-Code.html">thanks to my post about Scott Rosenbergâ€™s <em>Dreaming in Code.</em></a>, which was linked by Hacker News. I also wrote <a href="2021/03/28/RMMess.html">a review of sorts of Sam Williamsâ€™s <em>Free as in Freedom,</em></a> a biography of Stallman. I just so happened to finish reading that book when Stallman was reinstated to the FSF, which made my post a bit more polemical than review.</p>

<p>This time, Iâ€™m going to turn to a modern classic: Gabriella Colemanâ€™s <strong>Coding Freedom: The Ethics and Aesthetics of Hacking.</strong></p>
