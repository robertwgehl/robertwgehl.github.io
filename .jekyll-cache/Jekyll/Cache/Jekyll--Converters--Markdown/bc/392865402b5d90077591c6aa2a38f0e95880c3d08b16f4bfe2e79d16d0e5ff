<p>Hi! This blog is meant to do two things.</p>

<p>First, one goal is to explore life as a <strong>“FOSS Academic”</strong> – someone who uses Free and Open Source technologies to do academic work. I’m hoping that my discussions of FOSS technologies in an academic setting help others – students, professors, university administrators – understand the benefits and values of FOSS in the academy. I’m not a developer, but I am a professor who’s been using FOSS to do his job for over a decade. I call this goal of exploring FOSS tools in the academy <strong>Goal 1</strong>.</p>

<p>Second, this blog has <strong>Goal 2</strong> – otherwise known as my <strong>nefarious purpose</strong>. I’m planning a book-length project about the culture, politics, and technical elements of FOSS. So, in addition to writing about using FOSS tools to do academic work, I will also write about the world of FOSS itself. Sometimes, the two topics will collide in a single post. My intent here is to be more open about my own research process and writing.</p>

<p>You can learn more about the goals of the blog in the <a href="/2020/11/27/introduction.html">introductory post</a>.</p>

<p>As for me, I’m <a href="https://www.robertwgehl.org">Robert W. Gehl</a>, a professor of Communication at Louisiana Tech University. My actual title is long: F. Jay Taylor Endowed Research Chair of Communication. The long title basically means I do research and teaching at Tech. I’ve also been a Fulbright Canada Research Chair of Communication, Media, and Film at the University of Calgary. I’ve written two books: <a href="http://tupress.temple.edu/book/1115"><em>Reverse Engineering Social Media</em></a>, which won the Association of Internet Researchers Nancy Baym Book Award, and <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/weaving-dark-web"><em>Weaving the Dark Web</em></a>. I’ve also published over two dozen peer-reviewed journal articles in venues such as <em>New Media &amp; Society</em>, <em>Communication Theory,</em> and <em>Social Media + Society.</em></p>
