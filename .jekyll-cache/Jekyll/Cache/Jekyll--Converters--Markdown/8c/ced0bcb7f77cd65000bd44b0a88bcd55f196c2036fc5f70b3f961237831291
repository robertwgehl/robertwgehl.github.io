I"Æ<p>A few months ago, I <a href="/2022/12/11/AOIR-social.html">wrote about the possibility of the Association on Internet Researchers running their own Mastodon instance</a>. I discussed the major concerns the organization had about running such an instance, and the direction the project is heading.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m excited to announce that AOIR.social is going to happen. In fact, <a href="https://aoir.social">itâ€™s live right now</a>, but weâ€™re not actively signing up AOIR members just yet. First, weâ€™re going to let our volunteer moderators join to learn the tooling (and the tooting).</p>

<p>And I have to do some work on preemptively blocking instances that donâ€™t share our values.</p>

<p>Oh, and we have to finalize our Code of Conduct (both for the Mastodon instance and for the organization as a whole).</p>

<p>And I want to investigate signing the [Mastodon Server Covenant]. (I want this to be a respectable part of the fediverse, after all).</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s probably more that Iâ€™m not thinking about, but in any caseâ€¦ itâ€™s happening, people!</p>

<p>So, lots to do! Stay tuned, AOIRfriends!</p>
