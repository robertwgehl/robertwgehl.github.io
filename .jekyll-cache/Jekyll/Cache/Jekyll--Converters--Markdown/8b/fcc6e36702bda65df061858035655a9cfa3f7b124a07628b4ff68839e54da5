I"<	<p>I’ve been struggling with having comments on this Jekyll-based static site for a while. For a bit, I used Staticman, but that died for some reason.</p>

<p>Then, it hit me: so many sites use Facebook comments. Why can’t I use Mastodon, the FOSS alternative social media system, to do something similar?</p>

<p>Fortunately, <a href="https://blog.xmgz.eu/jekyll-mastodon-comment/">this guide</a> provided all the code I could need to do exactly that!</p>

<p>So this is a test run. Feel free to comment on it using your Mastodon account. (I think other federated accounts might work, but not sure – if so, let me know in the comments!)</p>

<p>If you don’t have a Mastodon account, don’t worry! You can <a href="https://joinmastodon.org">sign up for an instance</a> and join the federated fun.</p>

<h2 id="update-1">UPDATE #1</h2>

<p>I’ve tested it a bit and have found a few things that give me pause:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It does not respect the distinction between Unlisted and Public privacy settings. Both will show up here.</li>
  <li>It <em>does</em> respect DM – that is, DMs do not show up as comments.</li>
  <li><del>It does not respect Content Warnings.</del> This has been fixed; see Update #3.</li>
</ul>

<p>With all that in mind, I think I may keep it (pending further testing) and include a warning in the “Comments” section.</p>

<h2 id="update-2">UPDATE #2</h2>
<p>Thanks to another Mastodoner, I found that if anyone who uses Mastodon to comment on a blog post deletes said comment, then it will also no longer appear on the blog. I think that’s a cool feature, but I’m thinking that I have be <em>extremely clear</em> about what happens when people comment on my blog. It’s going to be public – very public – not just in the federation, but also on my website.</p>

<p>However, I’m not 100% certain this is wise. I’d love to get more opinions from Mastodon users. Feel free to leave them in the comments – or, to be certain that your opinion is expressed privately, DM me (@robertwgehl@scholar.social).</p>

<h2 id="update-3">UPDATE #3</h2>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://mastodon.acc.sunet.se/@ashwinvis">@ashwinvis</a>, the comments system now supports Content Warnings. @ashwinvis wrote a few lines of Javascript that did the trick, resulting in CWs appearing with a small dropdown.</p>

<p>I love FOSS.</p>
