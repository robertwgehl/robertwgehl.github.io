I"Ø<p>Yesterday, I taught one of the final meetings of my undergrad â€œEthics and the Mediaâ€ course at York. Weâ€™re using <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/digital-media-ethics-charles-ess/7513541?ean=9781509533428">Charle Essâ€™s <em>Digital Media Ethics</em> (3rd edition)</a> as our textbook, and so weâ€™ve had a good guide to ethical theories, such as virtue ethics, deontology, utilitarianism, and feminist ethics of care. (I also supplement Ess with readings and ideas from Shannon Vallor, Kwame Gyekye, Carissa Veliz, Michael Zimmer, and others).</p>

<p>Much of the course has been about learning the ethical theories and then discussing <a href="https://mediaengagement.org/vertical/media-ethics/">case studies</a>. Itâ€™s been quite an enjoyable course to teach, particularly because Iâ€™ve seen the students go from the vague and intellectually unsatisfying statement â€œEthics is a subjective, personal thingâ€ to the more robust â€œLet me lay out how a virtue ethicist would think about this.â€</p>

<p>But I wanted to have at least one day of the course dedicated to applied ethics. Instead of looking at a case that happened in the past, I wanted the students to apply the ethical theories to a concrete situation.</p>

<p>And these days, we have a great situation in digital media ethics to consider: what to do when we start up a Mastodon server?</p>

<p>In this post, Iâ€™ll write up what we did in the class, in case anyone out there wants to try something similar.</p>
