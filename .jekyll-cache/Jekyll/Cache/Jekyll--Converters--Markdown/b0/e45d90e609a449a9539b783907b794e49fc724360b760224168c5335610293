I"¯<p>Iâ€™ve not written much about my most recent book, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/social-engineering">Social Engineering</a> (MIT Press, 2022) on this blog. It didnâ€™t seem like a good topic for this FOSS-centric blog. When I did write about it, I focused on the fact that my co-author, Sean Lawson, and I were able to use FOSS (particularly Nextcloud) to write it. In the parlance of this blog, thatâ€™s a decidedly Goal 1 topic â€“ about using FOSS tools to do academic work.</p>

<p>So, Iâ€™ve focused instead on my next project, the Goal 2 project of writing a book about FOSS alternative social media. My idea is to use this blog to publicly write that book. Such public writing is new to me â€“ itâ€™s even a bit intimidating â€“ but seems appropriate for this topic.</p>

<p>But the more Iâ€™m digging into what it means to envision, make, and realize ethical, FOSS, alternative social media, the more I realize my latest book, <em>Social Engineering,</em> is directly relevant to the project. So, this post is a way for me to make those connections.</p>
