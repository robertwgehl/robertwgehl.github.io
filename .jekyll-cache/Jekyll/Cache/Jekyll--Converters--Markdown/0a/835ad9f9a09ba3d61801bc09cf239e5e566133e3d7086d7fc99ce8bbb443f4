I"ü<p>Thereâ€™s exciting news on the Zotero front!</p>

<p>Zotero just announced a <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/pdf_reader_preview">preview of their new tab system, complete with a built-in PDF reader</a>.</p>

<p>They plan on releasing these features to the public in Version 6, but anyone itching to try it can use the development version of Zotero. This post will discuss how to install Zoteroâ€™s beta in Ubuntu Mate 18.04, though the approach should be similar for other Linux distros.</p>
