[Linux Unplugged](https://linuxunplugged.com/) is at it again: it's Tuxies time! I voted, and [you can, too](https://tuxies.party). Unlike last year, this year they're using a self-hosted Nextcloud form -- brilliant! Like [[last year](2020/12/10/The-Tuxies-Academic-Style.html), I've voted based on my experience as a FOSS Academic. My picks may not win -- but they might just help you live the FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream.

Best Newcomer/Became Well Known
-------------------------------
I'm going to keep pounding a drum few of us will hear, but **Zotero** needs to be known about. Zotero, which is a bibliographic management system, released a beta of a new PDF reader and annotator which has greatly improved how I do academic research. 

Text Editor
-----------
**Nano.** It just gets things done.

Distro of the Year
------------------ 
**Manjaro.** I predict Fedora's going to win because it was constantly discussed on Linux Unplugged and I suspect the will go with it. But I switched my main work laptop from Debian-based distros to Manjaro this year and have been so impressed. I didn't realize what a relief it is not to have to worry about doing a massive upgrade -- just keep rolling along instead. 

Server
------ 
I use Ubuntu LTS for stability, so I probably have no business making this call. But I have been impressed by the organizational structure of **AlmaLinux.** Every time I hear one of their representatives speak on podcasts, I can just hear their unwavering commitment to creating a community-owned enterprise Linux server distro. In fact, I think I need to study their structure a bit further.

Desktop Environment
-------------------
This one won't win, but I love **MATE** and will defend it with chrysknives. I've said it before, but when it comes to desktops, I'm a Linux Luddite.

Largest impact
---------------
I suspect Pipewire will win, but I think **Wireguard** has been brilliant. I've used it extensively to create a virtual private network of devices, including Android phones, all using an installation of Pi-Hole to block unwanted traffic. A big, big benefit I've seen is countering some bad practices from my ISP: if I listen to internet radio streams on my regular connection, they are dropped after a few minutes. Run them through Wireguard and the streams will flow for days. 

Self-hosted service 
-------------------
**Pi-hole.** Ad-blocking, local DNS, child-proofing my kid's computer, blocking Facebook from my network... it's all possible with Pi-Hole. Couple this with Wireguard and I can block ads on any connection, anywhere in the world.
