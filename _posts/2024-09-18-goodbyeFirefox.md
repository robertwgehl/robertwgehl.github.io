I think I'm going to stop using Firefox altogether. It was a tiny little weather app that did it.

So, one day I opened a new tab in Firefox and there it was: a weather report. A tiny little temp reading for my area. I didn't think about it much, but someone on the fediverse noted that this little weather app is sponsored by AccuWeather, a company [long criticized for its attempt to privatize public weather information](https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/environment/project-2025-paywall-weather/). Hovering over the little temp reading revealed this to be true -- it said, "Sponsored by AccuWeather."

And that broke me.

To be fair, it's not the only thing. [Like others](https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/discussions/firefox-changing-my-settings-on-update/m-p/14155), I've started to see privacy settings being reset every time I update Firefox. I set the default search to be Startpage instead of Google -- an update wiped that and set it to Google, again. I set my homepage to not have Pocket or sponsored links -- an update wiped that.

Pretty soon each new tab suggested I go to Facebook. _Fucking Facebook_.

Mozilla bashing has become kind of a common sport, so much so that one of my favorite podcasts, _Late Night Linux_, has gotten bored of doing it. But once I saw the little AccuWeather thingy, I started watching for critical comments on Mozilla. And I saw what many others have already pointed out:
* [Firefox browser share plummeting in inverse proportion to CEO pay](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/networking/the-fall-of-firefox-mozillas-once-popular-web-browser-slides-into-irrelevance/)
* [weird ideas about integrating ad-tech](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-anonym-raising-the-bar-for-privacy-preserving-digital-advertising/)
* [AI bullshit](https://www.mozilla.ai/_)
* [and an end to the laudable experiment with the fediverse](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/mozilla-social-faq).

My attitude towards these critical takes has long been to ignore them. "Whatever Mozilla wants to do is fine as long as they make a good browser," I said to myself. But lately it seems like they're actively trying to kill off Firefox rather than continuing to make a great browser.

The thing is, with all the papercuts, Firefox is still quite good. But this is FOSS. Forks are a thing. I'm now testing out [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/), a privacy-conscious fork of Firefox, and so far, so good.

What's sad about this, though, is that I've been using Firefox for nearly two decades -- almost as long as Firefox has been around. It was my [introduction point into the world of FOSS](/2020/12/15/FOSS-Journey.html). First it, then OpenOffice, then Ubuntu, and now I run as much FOSS as I can.

Maybe I will come back to Firefox, but if not, I'm still grateful for its role in my career.
