This is just a short note to announce that, thanks to some generous funding at York University, I am recruiting graduate students (MA and PhD) as well as post-docs. I'd like to work with folks on alternative social media, in particular. Methodologically, I tend to use qualitative approaches, such as digital ethnography, software studies, and grounded theory/situational analysis. I am a critical scholar, as well, so I prefer working with people who are actively examining power relations in technical systems.

Grad students, York has two programs I'm affiliated with: [Science and Technology Studies](https://www.yorku.ca/gradstudies/sts/) and [Communication and Culture](https://www.yorku.ca/gradstudies/cmct/), a communication and media studies focused program. My understanding is that STS in particular is eager for students, so if you have any background in STS, I would recommend that route. Either way, please do contact me via email (I have a protonmail account, robertwgehl) or [find me on the fediverse](https://aoir.social/@rwg).

Post-docs, York U has received a very generous grant called [Connected Minds](https://www.yorku.ca/research/connected-minds/opportunities/) which includes many funding opportunities. Contact me if you have some interest there.

[Here's a PDF of my CV](https://www.robertwgehl.org/text/gehl_vita.pdf) if you want to get a sense of my work.
