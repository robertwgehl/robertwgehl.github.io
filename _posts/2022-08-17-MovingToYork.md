Yeah, I know I haven't posted in a while, but hear me out: there's a good reason.

I'm moving to Canada!

Today, I signed an offer to join York University in Toronto as the Ontario Research Chair of Digital Governance for Social Justice. If you're reading that job title and thinking "that's a really good fit for the [Goal 2, ethical alternative social media book project](/2022/01/06/Goal2.html)!", you'd be right. The central project I'm blogging about here on FOSS Academic is *exactly* what I'd be pursuing at York.

More to come, but I just wanted to break the silence a bit -- in between doing all the paperwork that comes with moving, of course!
