It's a simple, yet deep ASM update for this week. Last week, I posted about some [recent research](/2024/11/22/ASMupdateResearch.html) in the realm of alternative social media. I also drew attention to the bibliography I maintain [here on this blog](/bib.html). In response to that post, folks on the fediverse alerted me to other bibliographic projects collecting research in related ideas. Here I want to highlight two of them.

<!-- more -->

## Fediverse Observatory

This is a [Zotero Library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/4861035/fediverse_observatory/items/LFCK293Q/library) with dozens of entries, some dating back to 2005. As the name implies, much of it focuses on the fediverse, but there are sub-libraries focusing on topics like "migration" across social media, social media fatigue, and Musk and Threads.

## Investigación sobre el Fediverso

This is a [library](https://www.pedrolr.es/research/infonomy2024/fediverseresearch.html) from Pedro Lázaro Rodríguez based in part on the citations from a [fediverse research paper](https://infonomy.scimagoepi.com/index.php/infonomy/article/view/34) published in _Infonomy_ 2024. It's divided into two sections, one focusing on research that has emerged since the _Infonomy_ paper, and the second with the original reference material for that paper.

## Libraries!

While this ASM update is just these two links, as you can see, this area of research is rapidly growing. I am not going to lie: I will gleefully mine these libraries for use in my own. For new researchers and grad students, there is a wealth of materials out there to gain insights into the world of alternative social media. It's such an exciting time!
