This is a minor update: the ASM Bibliography is returning to its original home [on the social media alternatives project](https://socialmediaalternatives.org/bib.html) page.

It's the same bibliography -- I just don't want to maintain two instances of it! 

It's kind of a homecoming for the bibliography. It is based on a [Zotero Group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/542752/social_media_alternatives_project_bibliography) that I set up for the Social Media Alternatives Project back in the mid-2010s. (Contact me if you're an academic and want to join that group.)

The bib has gone through a lot of changes lately -- the [Network of Alternative Social Media Researchers](https://socialmediaalternatives.org/members.html) have been adding quite a bit to it. It's really exciting to see the growth of the field!
