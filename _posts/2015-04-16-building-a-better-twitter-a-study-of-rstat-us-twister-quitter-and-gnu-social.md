I'm happy to announce that my paper on the Twitter alternatives [rstat.us](https://rstat.us), [Twister](http://twister.net.co/), [Quitter](https://quitter.se), and [Gnu social](https://www.gnu.org/software/social/) has been accepted to the online journal _[Fibreculture](http://fibreculturejournal.org/)_. The paper, "[Building a Better Twitter: A Study of the Twitter Alternatives Gnu Social, Quitter, Rstat.Us, and Twister](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2595247)â€¨," draws on interviews with social media alternative makers to explore the (productive) frictions that occur when the alternatives make contact with with the mainstream Twitter. I use my previous work on "critical reverse engineering" to examine four points of contact: pragmatic, genealogical, legal, and normative.

I am so grateful to the social media alternative developers who spoke to me: Matt Lee and Donald Robertson (Gnu social); Hannes Mannerheim (Quitter); Miguel Freitas (Twister); and Dave "Wilkie" Wilkinson and Carol Nichols (rstat.us). I've published here on the S-MAP [my interview with Carol](http://www.socialmediaalternatives.org/?p=17) (it's a great read -- check it out), and I hope to publish more interviews with developers and users.
