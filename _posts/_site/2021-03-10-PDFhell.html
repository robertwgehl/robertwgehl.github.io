<p>Why in the year 2021 is it hard to edit PDFs in Linux?</p>

<p>Please don’t tell me to use Okular.</p>

<p>Please don’t tell me to use LaTex.</p>

<p>I’m barely keeping things together using Atril and pdfunite in the command line.</p>

<p>I popped over to <a href="https://itsfoss.com/pdf-editors-linux/">It’s FOSS</a> to see their list of top applications. When your list starts with LibreOffice Draw… I don’t know what to say. It gets worse from there, going to a bunch of commercial, proprietary solutions.</p>

<p>I now work for an organization that makes heavy use of PDF forms. I lament the lost hours.</p>

<p>Printing and scanning seems like the most efficient thing to do.</p>

<p>At this point, feel free to tell me to switch to Windows.</p>
