<p>According to <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/aerospace/robotic-exploration/nasa-designed-perseverance-helicopter-rover-fly-autonomously-mars"></a><em>IEEE Spectrum</em> and <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/linux-is-now-on-mars-thanks-to-nasas-perseverance-rover"><em>PC Magazine</em></a>, Linux is now on Mars. Specifically, the drone copter is running the Linux kernel on an off-the-shelf Qualcomm Snapdragon processor. Perhaps this marks the beginning of the end of proprietary operating systems on the Red Planet?</p>

<p>Good to see the people of NASA are living the FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream.</p>
