<p>I made a change.</p>

<p>I droppped Ubuntu 18.04 for Manjaro (Mate, of course). And it’s going great!</p>

<p>Manjaro feels a lot like Linux Mint back around 2010 – it’s detecting hardware (including hardware needing proprietary drivers) flawlessly. In fact, that was my biggest concern with the Dell computer I’m using. The day I got this computer it had Ubuntu 18.04 installed, which I was fine with. The first thing I did, however, broke the hardware support: I updated the computer. That’s it. &lt;pre&gt;sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade -y&lt;/pre&gt; killed the sound and, very likely, the special power management firmware this Dell required.</p>

<p>After working with Dell support, I got a particular Ubuntu image and got things running. However, I was always nervous that any upgrade would kill a lot of hardware. I even went so far as to stick with one kernel.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I kept hearing about Manjaro – how they’re working on the PinePhone, how many people are running it, and how running an Arch-based distro means that there’s no need to do OS reinstallations. Given that Ubuntu 18.04 is showing its age, I tried running Manjaro off a USB drive on the laptop and… all good. So I took the plunge and installed Manjaro instead of Ubuntu.</p>

<p>Using Manjaro’s community version with MATE has gone pretty much seamlessly. I can still do the setup I prefer, with devilspie moving windows to workspaces, and all my favorite applications (Libreoffice, Zotero) are running great.</p>

<p>Plus, now I get to explore the world of pacman. I am really comfortable with apt, but pacman is just as easy to use, and I’m starting to see the appeal of having the latest versions of various software packages.</p>

<p>In fact, I’ve gone Manjaro Mental and put it on my son’s laptop and another computer, as well.</p>

<p>I still have Ubuntu boxes – mainly as servers – so I don’t think I will ever leave Ubuntu behind, but for now I’m diggin’ Manjaro.</p>

<p>But, I still know: I cannot truly say “I use Arch btw…”</p>
