<p>This post is to test <a href="https://staticman.net/">Staticman</a> comments. I’ll edit this post later to update my progress. For now, if anyone stumbles across this and wants to add a “test” comment or something helpful, feel free!</p>

<p>I’m basing this process of this <a href="https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2020/02/05/now-with-comments.html">helpful blog post</a> from Travis Downs of Performance Matters. Thank you!</p>

<p>Update 1: There are clearly problems in my configuration, and so I must keep debugging. But it’s time for a walk.</p>

<p>Update 2: Success in posting a comment after turning ReCaptcha off. However, not sure if I set things up to <em>display</em> the comment…</p>

<p>Update 3: Success in getting a comment posted! But the workflow is very convoluted. I know Staticman uses Github pull requests to work, so I have to merge each comment. That’s fine. However, after I do so, I will have to move the data from my local version of my static site and then rebuild it via Jekyll. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INX-KrjaNOo">There has to be a better way</a>! And I will figure it out.</p>

<p>And, I do know I will have to style the comments, as well. One thing at a time.</p>

<p>Update 4: I think it’s done! Comment forms are styled for desktop and mobile, and the workflow is now improved. I initially set up my Github repository to be only the contents of the _site folder, but now the whole thing (warts and all) is in Github, which makes moderating comments much easier.</p>

<p>Once again, thanks go to Travis Downs for his exhaustive post on how to get Staticman going, as well as some of his code.</p>

<p>I do have a few more tweaks – most notably, to de-Google-ify the whole thing, but the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwZwkk7q25I">system is not down</a>.</p>
