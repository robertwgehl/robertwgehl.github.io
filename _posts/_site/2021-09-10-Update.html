<p>I took a bit more time off, at least from this blog, but it’s late September and I really should be back in school. And I am. Classes just started up at LaTech, and with them my attention turns to reading and writing about FOSS.</p>

<p>One thing I have done in the intervening past few weeks is publish another post to The Reboot, this time <a href="https://thereboot.com/cracking-open-the-android-ios-grip-on-smartphones-and-the-mobile-internet/">focusing on the state of FOSS phones</a>. I had the pleasure of talking to Ioana Luncheon of Fairphone, Lukasz Erecinski of PINE64, and Félim Whiteley of Late Night Linux.</p>

<p>I’ve also been digging into the <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/">Ethical Source</a> movement, which is producing a new version of the Hippocratic License for software projects.</p>

<p>And, I’ve been steadily working on a co-authored paper on Mastodon, the federated social networking site.</p>

<p>So, a lot going on, and a lot more to come!</p>

<p>In fact, I’m getting ever closer to revealing my Goal 2: Book Project on the blog. I want to blog out my progress openly. To do that, of course, I’ll have to clarify my project!</p>

<p>Oh, and other stuff on the to-do list includes figuring out a new commenting system, since Staticman is no longer working.</p>
