This cover features artwork, "Untitled no 7," from the [artist Marcia X](https://artistmarciax.com/). In addition to being an artist, Marcia is a key figure in the development of the [#fediblock hashtag](https://subscribers.artistmarciax.com/fediblock-a-tiny-history-2/), which is an essential tool for moderation on the fediverse. Marcia was one of the first folks to talk to me about the fediverse, right at the start of my planning of this book, and their insights into its history -- including its troubling history for people of color and Black folks -- had a massive impact on the shape of _Move Slowly_.

Oh, and Marcia is a DJ, as well. I've had writing sessions listening to her [Afro-Caribbean techno jams](https://artistmarciax.com/dj-sets/).

I selected "Untitled no 7" because I felt the kaleidoscopic image held connections and fragmentation -- I hope it's clear how this kind of tension is a key part of the book, as well as fediverse history. I see the fediverse as existing between individuals' ability to link to each other and the ability for communities to sever connections, and often the decision to connect or defederate hinges on deeply-seated aspects of identity. Marcia and their experience figure heavily into a chapter that dives into that tension, so I was very happy she agreed to let Oxford use their art for the cover.

The book isn't out yet but you can [preorder it](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/move-slowly-and-build-bridges-9780197776681?lang=en&cc=ca) as a hardcover, paperback, or e-book directly from Oxford.
