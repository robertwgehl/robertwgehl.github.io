I have two new alternative social media-related publications.

First, in _The New Inquiry_, [I have an interview with Lameth](http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/socializing-the-dark-web/), the creator and admin of the Tor-based social network Galaxy2. I'm really grateful to Lameth for all his insights into social media and the dark web. Galaxy2 is [featured in the S-MAP](http://www.socialmediaalternatives.org/archive/collections/show/10). Even better, [you ought to go to it](http://w363zoq3ylux5rf5.onion/) ([Tor Browser Bundle](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en) required).

Second, I have posted a [forthcoming version](http://ssrn.com/abstract=2625658) of "The Case for Alternative Social Media," a paper that will appear in a special issue of _Social Media + Society_. It draws on interviews with a variety of alternative social media makers and users. I'm trying to define alternative social media. I focus on their anti-advertising stances, their pedagogical features, and their experimentation with surveillance and democracy.

As always, feedback is welcome!
