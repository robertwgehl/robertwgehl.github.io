This is a minor update, but I hope it's useful to anyone interested in doing alternative social media research. I've long hosted a Zotero group, the [Social Media Alternatives Project](https://www.zotero.org/groups/542752/social_media_alternatives_project_bibliography), which has a library. As much as I love Zotero, though, I've not had much luck with groups for fostering public discussion. Their libraries are a bit too tucked away.

Since many people are requesting resources about ASM, and that Zotero library may not be the easiest thing to find, I'm going to regularly port that library to a [Bibliography](../bib.html) page on this blog. I've got to do some cleaning up, but there's some good stuff in there. As Steve Brule might say: check it out!
