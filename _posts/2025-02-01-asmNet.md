For years, researching alternative social media has been a bit lonely. But not anymore!

Over the past few months, I've been recruiting people to join an email list for academics who study alternative social media, broadly conceived. Every week or so, I'd send an update about the state of ASM, and folks would share articles they've written. 

It's gone quite well, and now we're going public with it!

## The Network of Alternative Social Media Researchers

The [Network of Alternative Social Media Researchers](https://socialmediaalternatives.org/) is a home page, blog, archive, and bibliography all centered on ASM research. We have a growing [members](https://socialmediaalternatives.org/members.html) page with short bios. As for the archive, I've kept my older project, the [S-MAP](https://socialmediaalternatives.org/archive/), where grad students and I collected screenshots of many past and current alternative social media.

These are early days for the project -- as you can see, I still have a bit of fine-tuning to do on the website. But I believe this project will lead to collaborations, panels, and even entire conferences exploring the world of ASM.

If you're an academic doing research in this space, please check of the [ASM network page](https://socialmediaalternatives.org/) for more information on joining us.
