title: Minor Update -- Tagging System

    - Goal 1

A minor update: I'm still learning how to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and one goal I had was a usable tagging system. I think I've achieved it! I want to study the problem more and see if I can't automate more parts of it, but so far, so good. If you have feedback, leave it in the comments!

Next goal: improving the design. I want to hire a designer to make a permanent logo and build the site color scheme around it. Or, maybe I will learn how to make my own logo. I also want to improve the font.
