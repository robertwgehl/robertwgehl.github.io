If Threads is the product, then the communities built on the fediverse are the by-product. The goal is to pick the corpse of Twitter, and along the way show that Facebook can be "interoperable" with other platforms.

When ActivityPub was being built, Facebook (the company now known as 'Meta') was no where to be found. (Google, Twitter, and Sina Weibo weren't around, either). This wasn't for lack of trying on the part of the Social Web Working Group. I should know -- I read all their minutes.

Now that ActivityPub is firmly established, there are meetings of a new group, the TK social comm group TK. And Meta (the company formerly known as 'Facebook') is also not involved. I should know -- I'm attending the meetings.

Just as Meta/Facebook in the past has simply appropriated our sociality for profit, they are now appropriating a free and open social protocol for profit.

Quite a few people are saying that Facebook's adoption of ActivityPub is going to be good for the fediverse.

Think of it this way -- if Threads has 50 million users, there is no way even the biggest node on the fediverse, Mastodon.social, can influence it. If Threads is able to federate, and even 1% of its users follow people on MAstodon.social, Mastodon.social will be loathe to block Threads -- even if Threads is as poorly moderated as other Meta products. This relationship would be incredibly asymmetrical.
