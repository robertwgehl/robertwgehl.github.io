A minor update: I have a new publication about [alternative social media](https://thereboot.com/creating-decentralized-social-media-alternatives-to-facebook-and-twitter/) in *The Reboot.* The piece discusses two FOSS alternatives to Twitter: the amazing, and yet likely [soon-to-be-defunct](http://twister.net.co/news/) Twister, which is a P2P, distributed microblog. I also discuss my favorite project, Mastodon.

[*The Reboot*](https://thereboot.com/) looks really promising -- it's a magazine dedicated to Internet criticism. I've been known to do a bit of that.

Another little update: I installed the Hyvor comment system but then removed it. It worked, which is great, but I missed [the free window](https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/removing-free-plan/) and I don't know if I have the traffic to justify using a paid plan. I may go back to it, but I want to explore other options first. Next up: [StaticMan](https://staticman.net/docs/).

Finally, I am teaching my child how to use Linux and want to make a recommendation: [BashCrawl](https://gitlab.com/slackermedia/bashcrawl)! It's a text-based game for the Bash terminal that teaches how to use bash commands. Within half an hour, my kid was showing me some cool bash techniques. Just download an archive, unzip it, and dive in.
