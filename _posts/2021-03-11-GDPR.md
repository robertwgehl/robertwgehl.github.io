A quick note to any readers in GDPR regulated areas: I'm in the USA, and I don't really do business in Europe. I don't really do business anywhere, to be honest. Anyway, I also really respect privacy concerns. So, in the interest of transparency, I want to note that I use a [Statcounter](https://www.statcounter.com) script to help track traffic to this blog.

You can see the Javascript in the page source for the blog, and I've also [made the stats public](https://statcounter.com/p5832197/summary/?account_id=1462290&login_id=3&code=6a0a1540cdf3119c0be6e16464d0d1fe&guest_login=1) (marvel at my traffic!).

If you block Javascript, I not only don't mind, nothing should change for you.

Moreover, if you have a better way to get basic traffic data for a Github.io-hosted static Jekyll blog, let me know in the comments or via Mastodon (@robertwgehl@scholar.social).
