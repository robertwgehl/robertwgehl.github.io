Sometimes, the FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream can hurt you. 

I spent the weekend installing [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) on a laptop. I'm starting to really like Manjaro after years of using Debian-based things like Ubuntu and Mint. I know using Manjaro doesn't really allow me to say "[I use Arch btw](https://us-browse.startpage.com/av/anon-image?piurl=https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FDplToN8UwAAVKrG.jpg&sp=1614633024Td5a5c55f91dbaa7f113abecead862dd2c93f7b804f24473957dcb450b1f72a9e)" but it's really fun, nonetheless.

I used my Manjaro box to write up a post for the blog, but then I had the bright idea of trying to install a second OS on it, I borked it, and then re-installed... losing the post I wrote. Ah, well. Such is FALD life.

I have Manjaro up and running (with MATE, of course), though -- I'm starting to think it could be my next working distro.

[That said, I'm writing this on an Ubuntu box.]
