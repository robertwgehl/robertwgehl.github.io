As avid readers of my blog know, I am livin' the [FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream](/tags/fald.html): I use FOSS tools to do my academic work. I use Nextcloud to manage files and [handle appointments](/2021/09/25/Appointments.html), Zotero and Zettlr to take notes, and LibreOffice Writer to write books and articles. This blog runs on Jekyll. I love it all!

But there has been one part of the Lifestyle that has consistently been a disappointment: [LibreOffice Impress](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/impress/), the presentation software. While I use Writer all the time and enjoy doing so, Impress has always bothered me. But I'm not one to complain too much, since LibreOffice software is provided free-of-charge and with a FOSS license. I've soldiered on with it to make presentations for conferences and class teaching.

But that might change. [Marp](https://marp.app/) -- the Markdown Presentation Ecosystem -- is poised to become a key part of the FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream. If you're familiar with Markdown, Marp is a really awesome tool.

## Thank you, Linux Matters
I learned about Marp from the [_Linux Matters_ podcast](https://linuxmatters.sh/43/). Like any good podcast episode, their discussion of Marp made me drop everything to learn more. As Mark on _Linux Matters_ explained, Marp allows for presentations to be built very quickly using Markdown. Since I use Markdown regularly to write up notes, particularly for class lectures, I was intrigued.

And when I started experimenting with Marp, I think Mark might have undersold it a bit!

## Markdown: It's That Easy
So, let's make a slide. Instead of firing up LibreOffice Impress, though, I just open a text editor a create a Markdown (.md) file.

First, I add "frontmatter," which tells the system how to handle the file:

```
---
marp: true
---
```

(You can do more with it than that, but we'll keep it simple).

Next, I start adding slides:

```
---
marp: true
---
# Slide Title

Slide Text
```
It's that easy.

That sort of thing [looks like this](https://robertwgehl.org/presentations/testPresentation.html#3).

Let's add another slide, this time with a list. Lists are handled in the Markdown way:

```
---
marp: true
---
# Slide Title
Slide Text

---
# Slide with List
- List item 1
- List item 2
- List item 3
```

Here's an [example of what that looks like](https://robertwgehl.org/presentations/testPresentation.html#4).

Of course, people often use more than just text in slides. I can add images, as well. Marp uses a syntax like this:

```
![command](imagefile.jpg)
```

Where "command" handles stuff like size, whether the image is in the background, opacity or the like. So a three-slide presentation with an image might look like this:
```
---
marp: true
---
# Slide Title
Slide Text

---
# Slide with List
- List item 1
- List item 2
- List item 3

---
![command](imagefile.jpg)
```

However, as you'll see, I prefer to do things with HTML, specifically the ```<figure>``` semantic tag, and style with CSS.

## CSS Zen Presentations
I love CSS. It blew me away when I saw the [CSS Zen Garden](https://csszengarden.com/), which was launched in 2003 to promote the full separation of content and presentation. I am no designer -- don't ask me to come up with color schemes! But I did take the CSS Zen Garden idea and apply it to [my website](https://www.robertwgehl.org), where you can choose your style if you view it on a laptop/tablet.

Add in [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), which allows for variables, and CSS is a really powerful tool.

So when I learned Marp uses CSS -- with some SASS-like aspects -- to handle the design of slides, I knew I would like it. 

Marp comes with some default themes, but I was keen to build my own. It turns out that all I had to do was write a CSS file and point the Marp command line to it via a terminal:

```
marp -w --theme ./CSS/custom.scss testPresentation.md
```

Here's a tip for those of you wanting to style via CSS: Marp uses the HTML semantic tag ```<section>``` for each slide. To customize the whole presentation, style ```<section>```, rather than ```<body>```, and you're good to go: the whole presentation will be formatted.

And what about specific slides? Marp uses an HTML-style comment you can add to Markdown: adding ```<!-- _class: CLASSNAME -->``` to the start of the specific slide adds a class that can be targeted. For example, I use ```<!-- _class: title -->``` on title slides. [Here's how that looks](https://robertwgehl.org/presentations/testPresentation.html#1).

## Avoiding Death by Powerpoint the CSS way

When I present, I do my best to avoid [death by Powerpoint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwpi1Lm6dFo). I use a lot of slides with minimal objects on a dark background. 

Of course, with CSS, backgrounds are fully under my control. And since Marp allows SASS-like variables, I could just set a global value for the background (as well as other elements) in my custom.scss file:

```
:root {
  font-family: "Cantarell Light", sans-serif;
  --text-color: #999999;
  --bg-color: #000;
  --standard-margin: 10%;
  --shadow: 20px 10px 10px #121212;
}
```

Here you'll see I lazily set it to black. I will likely choose some other verydark color, but for now that will do. (And, if I want to change it, I just have to adjust that one value. That's it!)

Avoiding Death by Powerpoint means I tend to use a lot of single images. Wth two little bits -- some Markdown/HTML and some CSS -- I can drop in images with formatting.

Here's the example Markdown:
```
<!-- _class: one-column -->
<figure>
  <img src="images/stage.jpg" alt="a picture of a theater stage">
  <figcaption>A theater stage </figcaption>
</figure>
```
Notice I've moved away from the simpler ```![command](image.jpg)``` structure to an HTML5 semantic markup, complete with alt text and caption. It's a bit more typing (or copypasting) but it will be worth it. Notice also the class, "one-column."

Now here's some corresponding CSS:
```
section.one-column figure {
  float: left;
  width: 90%;
  margin-left:8%;
  margin-top: 4%;
}

img {
  width: 96%;
  float: left;
  z-index:-1;
}

figcaption {
  margin-top: -8%;
  font-size: 200%;
  width: 80%;
  line-height: 200%;
  float: left;
  text-align: center;
  background-color:var(--bg-color);
  opacity: .8;
  z-index:1;
}
```

The result can [be seen here](https://robertwgehl.org/presentations/testPresentation.html#6). Here's a screenshot, too:

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/presentationExample.png" alt="a screenshot of an example presentation slide. It's a picture of the woods on a black background.">
  <figcaption>A screenshot of the slide</figcaption>
</figure>

## I can make it do things LibreOffice Impress never could

Much like [Kurt with his magazines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxNYAe85L20), with CSS I can make presentations do whatever I like. Including something that has eluded me in LibreOffice Impress for years: captions for images. That picture of the woods above includes a caption, styled with CSS.

CSS has a lot of power, and I'm only scratching the surface of what could be done. Once my CSS template is complete, all I have to do from here on out is edit Markdown files. This can work for academic presentations as well as for class lectures (which I often base off Markdown files edited in Zettlr.)

## Don't forget about HTML

In the above example, I link to a [specific slide in the presentation.](https://robertwgehl.org/presentations/testPresentation.html#6). I can link to any point of the presentation. On the web. In beautiful HTML, with alt text for images. 

This is so cool!

All I have to do is run a terminal command with marp-cli:

```
marp -w --theme ./CSS/custom.scss testPresentation.md
```

Marp autogenerates an HTML file with CSS included. I move that to a server and boom! The presentation is online. This is so cool! 

And I've taken a look -- it looks very similar across devices. Responsive!

Now, instead of futzing with a LibreOffice .OPD file (or worse, so much worse, a .PPTX file), I can just post my presentations to the web and run them from there. It includes a presentation view, which shows notes that I put in the corresponding Markdown file within HTML comments. 

Or, if I want to run it off my local machine, I can just present a local HTML file.

## What's next?

I'm going to do it: I'm going all-on on Marp for a while. If things go poorly, I'll update this blog accordingly. But right now, I suspect Marp is a future fixture of the FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream.
