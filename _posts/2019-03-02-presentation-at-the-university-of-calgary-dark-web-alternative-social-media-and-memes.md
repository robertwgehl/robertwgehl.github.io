_Robert W. Gehl_

I am heading home from a great visit to the Institute of Humanities at the University of Calgary, where I gave a keynote, titled, "[A Deep Dive into the Marianas Web: Surveillance, Information, and Mythologies of the Dark Web](https://www.ucalgary.ca/events/calendar/talk-dark-web-invited-speaker-robert-w-gehl)."

This talk is based on [a paper I'm working on](https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:20325/) about the [Marianas Web meme](http://imgur.com/vvXru), a meme that began in 2011 or 2012 and has circulated the Internet in various forms.

Along the way, the talk draws on a common event I saw happening on Dark Web social media ([alternative social media that exists on Tor, I2P, or Freenet](https://socialmediaalternatives.org/archive/items/browse?tags=dark+web)), where new users ask, "Ok, I've made it to Tor. How do I go deeper? How do I go to the Dark Web?"

While the meme has been debunked ([most eloquently by Violet Blue](https://www.engadget.com/2015/12/18/the-myth-of-marianas-web-the-darkest-corner-of-the-internet/)), in my talk I took it seriously, uncovering the anxieties that the meme reflects. I argue that the meme associates spatial metaphors of the Internet, digital immateriality, and post-truth politics into a potent mix.

The talk was part of a larger conversation happening at Calgary about social media. The Institute of the Humanities put together an essay contest for undergraduate students on "[Social Media: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.](https://ucalgaryessaycontest.weebly.com/results.html)" The winning entries (by [Lorianne Reuser](https://ucalgaryessaycontest.weebly.com/results.html), [Daniel Huss](https://medium.com/@daniel.n.huss/old-wisdom-new-media-35428563d6f1), [Bryn Waidson](https://medium.com/@brynwaids/my-value-as-a-woman-f70400af9b4f), and [Max Kurapov](https://medium.com/@mkurapov/return-to-social-media-id-rather-start-smoking-da68b6e6b79b)) as well as the work of my co-keynoter Safaneh Neyshabouri, prompted excellent discussions of the problems of (corporate) social media: its [consumerism,](https://medium.com/@brynwaids/my-value-as-a-woman-f70400af9b4f) its [addictiveness](https://medium.com/@mkurapov/return-to-social-media-id-rather-start-smoking-da68b6e6b79b), its [valorization of the sensational over the sober](https://medium.com/@daniel.n.huss/old-wisdom-new-media-35428563d6f1). To be fair, the discussion also touched on [everyday resistance](https://www.ucalgary.ca/utoday/issue/2019-02-13/small-acts-defiance-social-media-help-bring-change-middle-east) and [deep discussions that can happen on corporate social media](https://medium.com/@loriannereuser/giving-up-the-microphone-whose-voices-are-heard-on-bookstagram-7da9f557b34c).

But one thing that bothered me about the conversation was: it was all corporate social media. It was mostly Instagram, a bit of Facebook, and a lot of Twitter. There's so much more!

So, once again, I banged my favorite drum: if we have issues with social media's centralization, distortion of sociality, and surveillance, then c'mon, people now: switch to a non-corporate, ad-free, decentralized alternative! These days, [I'm liking Mastodon](http://scholar.social).

So I was glad that some of the anxieties I argued were reflected in the fake Marianas meme were also explored by the students, and I was happy to plug the alternatives once again.
