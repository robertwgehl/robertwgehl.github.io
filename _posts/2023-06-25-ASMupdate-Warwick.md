This update focuses on the University of Warwick [Mastodon Research Symposium](https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/4d682da3-3b4e-4909-9239-743d86cc7dcc@09bacfbd-47ef-4465-9265-3546f2eaf6bc).

Nate Tkacz, Carlos CÃ¡mara-Menoyo, and Fangzhou Zhang put on a wonderful, and intensive, two days focused on Mastodon and the broader fediverse.

Particularly of value, I thought, was the second day, which was unfortunately not streamed. We gathered together to talk about research ethics and methods. I posted some notes about what we said on the fediverse, using the [#MastoSymposium hashtag](https://aoir.social/tags/mastosymposium).

In my view, one of the most important conversations we need to have -- and openly have -- is about research ethics *with* the fediverse. I talked about this at length [in my plenary presentation](
https://nextcloud.robertwgehl.org/index.php/s/G34Y5X2PoNBq5Xp).

And the point was hammered home for me on day 2 by the [SysterServer](https://systerserver.net/) collective, a group that hosts some instances and who attended the workshop. They aren't academics, so they aren't concerned with filling up CVs. But they have needs. Ethical research *with* them could help address their needs. Our research ought to resonate with the fediverse.

So what's next? I believe we can continue this conversation at the [AOIR preconference](
https://aoir.org/aoir2023/preconfworkshops/#building) that several of us are hosting.

And of course, let's keep talking research ethics on the fediverse -- a conversation that has been happening for years -- see [here](https://apintandaparma.club/katlh/research-ethics-and-the-fediverse) and [here](https://blogghoran.se/2020/01/27/on-scraping-mastodon/) and [here](https://www.sunclipse.org/wp-content/downloads/2020/01/open-letter.html) for just three examples.
