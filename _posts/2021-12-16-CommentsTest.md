I've been struggling with having comments on this Jekyll-based static site for a while. For a bit, I used Staticman, but that died for some reason.

Then, it hit me: so many sites use Facebook comments. Why can't I use Mastodon, the FOSS alternative social media system, to do something similar?

Fortunately, [this guide](https://blog.xmgz.eu/jekyll-mastodon-comment/) provided all the code I could need to do exactly that!

So this is a test run. Feel free to comment on it using your Mastodon account. (I think other federated accounts might work, but not sure -- if so, let me know in the comments!)

If you don't have a Mastodon account, don't worry! You can [sign up for an instance](https://joinmastodon.org) and join the federated fun.
