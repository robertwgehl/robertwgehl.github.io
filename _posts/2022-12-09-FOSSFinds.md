A short FOSS Finds this time, but it contains something worth watching out for.

This week I attended a [web seminar](https://meedan.com/event/webinar-trust-and-safety-on-the-fediverse) run by Darius Kazemi (creator of the Hometown fork of Mastodon), Kat Lo, a community moderator, and Aaron Huslage, a computer security professional. It was about Trust and Safety on the fediverse. The event was sponsored by Darius's employer, Meedan.

I believe the webinar (or a version of it) will be available in video form. I will watch for it and post an update here when I see a link. For now, if you're interested in content moderation, I'd strongly recommend watching out for a video version of the webinar -- especially because of the Q and A.

The webinar itself was quite a good overview of moderation on the fediverse, talking about blocking, muting and the like, so if you need to know more about that, it's worth a watch.

But during the Q and A, I heard the most interesting stuff. Darius and others talked about a lot of emerging projects that might be worth investigating. For example, co-op moderation collectives, which would offer their moderation know-how to new fediverse instances. I don't have specifics here, but this sounds fascinating! Also, Darius talked about forthcoming legal guides to running instances. Again, no specifics yet, but something to watch for. Or, reach out to [Darius](http://tinysubversions.com/) -- he seems really interested in helping others with these issues.
