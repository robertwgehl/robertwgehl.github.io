<p><em>Robert W. Gehl</em></p>

<p>I am heading home from a great visit to the Institute of Humanities at the University of Calgary, where I gave a keynote, titled, “<a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/events/calendar/talk-dark-web-invited-speaker-robert-w-gehl">A Deep Dive into the Marianas Web: Surveillance, Information, and Mythologies of the Dark Web</a>.”</p>

<p>This talk is based on <a href="https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:20325/">a paper I’m working on</a> about the <a href="http://imgur.com/vvXru">Marianas Web meme</a>, a meme that began in 2011 or 2012 and has circulated the Internet in various forms.</p>

<p>Along the way, the talk draws on a common event I saw happening on Dark Web social media (<a href="https://socialmediaalternatives.org/archive/items/browse?tags=dark+web">alternative social media that exists on Tor, I2P, or Freenet</a>), where new users ask, “Ok, I’ve made it to Tor. How do I go deeper? How do I go to the Dark Web?”</p>

<p>While the meme has been debunked (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015/12/18/the-myth-of-marianas-web-the-darkest-corner-of-the-internet/">most eloquently by Violet Blue</a>), in my talk I took it seriously, uncovering the anxieties that the meme reflects. I argue that the meme associates spatial metaphors of the Internet, digital immateriality, and post-truth politics into a potent mix.</p>

<p>The talk was part of a larger conversation happening at Calgary about social media. The Institute of the Humanities put together an essay contest for undergraduate students on “<a href="https://ucalgaryessaycontest.weebly.com/results.html">Social Media: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.</a>” The winning entries (by <a href="https://ucalgaryessaycontest.weebly.com/results.html">Lorianne Reuser</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@daniel.n.huss/old-wisdom-new-media-35428563d6f1">Daniel Huss</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@brynwaids/my-value-as-a-woman-f70400af9b4f">Bryn Waidson</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/@mkurapov/return-to-social-media-id-rather-start-smoking-da68b6e6b79b">Max Kurapov</a>) as well as the work of my co-keynoter Safaneh Neyshabouri, prompted excellent discussions of the problems of (corporate) social media: its <a href="https://medium.com/@brynwaids/my-value-as-a-woman-f70400af9b4f">consumerism,</a> its <a href="https://medium.com/@mkurapov/return-to-social-media-id-rather-start-smoking-da68b6e6b79b">addictiveness</a>, its <a href="https://medium.com/@daniel.n.huss/old-wisdom-new-media-35428563d6f1">valorization of the sensational over the sober</a>. To be fair, the discussion also touched on <a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/utoday/issue/2019-02-13/small-acts-defiance-social-media-help-bring-change-middle-east">everyday resistance</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@loriannereuser/giving-up-the-microphone-whose-voices-are-heard-on-bookstagram-7da9f557b34c">deep discussions that can happen on corporate social media</a>.</p>

<p>But one thing that bothered me about the conversation was: it was all corporate social media. It was mostly Instagram, a bit of Facebook, and a lot of Twitter. There’s so much more!</p>

<p>So, once again, I banged my favorite drum: if we have issues with social media’s centralization, distortion of sociality, and surveillance, then c’mon, people now: switch to a non-corporate, ad-free, decentralized alternative! These days, <a href="http://scholar.social">I’m liking Mastodon</a>.</p>

<p>So I was glad that some of the anxieties I argued were reflected in the fake Marianas meme were also explored by the students, and I was happy to plug the alternatives once again.</p>
