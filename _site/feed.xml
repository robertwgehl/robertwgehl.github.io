When Mastodon saw a massive influx of new members. When Mastodon admins were struggling to keep up with the influx but ultimately showed that the network can, in fact, scale up. It was, in my view, the biggest stress on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/&quot;&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt; protocol – and ActivityPub kicked ass. Millions of people signed up for Mastodon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the titular Mastodon “bump.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I’ve published academic articles on Mastodon, during that Eternal Muskvember, I was approached by a lot of journalists (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-users-mastodon-meltdown/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/ninetonoon/audio/2018866818/twitter-users-seek-alternative-to-musk-run-platform&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketplace.org/shows/make-me-smart/unpacking-mastodon/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, for example) to talk about Mastodon, answering questions ranging from “what is it?” to “will it replace Twitter?” It was an exciting and sometimes exasperating time. I basically told myself, “Self, this sort of media attention is rare. Enjoy it, but know that it won’t last.” And indeed, a few weeks later, the story died down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also told myself to expect the inevitable follow-up. That’s what I’m writing about here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many readers of this blog are likely aware, after the new year, Mastodon’s active user base dropped off. As with every wave of social media movement from platform to platform, some percentage of people just don’t stick with the new site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s the titular Mastodon “slump.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I got an interview request from WIRED’s Amanda Hoover, who was working on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/the-mastodon-bump-is-now-a-slump/amp&quot;&gt;a story&lt;/a&gt; about how Mastodon’s drop in active users signaled that it had failed in its mission to replace Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, before I go any further I will say Hoover’s reporting on Mastodon has been excellent. She asks great questions, and she does more than just interview Eugen Rochko – she talks to instance admins, lawyers, and academics like myself. And, in fact, the article I’m going to critique is quite good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I am going to use her latest WIRED article to illustrate an all-too-common trope in reporting on alternative social media: it’s what I call “The Killer Hype Cycle.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-killer-hype-cycle&quot;&gt;The Killer Hype Cycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here’s the Killer Hype Cycle, as a couple colleagues and I describe it in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hcommons.org/deposits/objects/hc:29856/datastreams/CONTENT/content&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Media and Society&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Killer Hype Cycles are often seen in tech reporting on alternatives to mainstream social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter. The Cycle goes like this: first, a journalist notices a fledgling alternative social media system. Looking for a click-worthy angle, the journalist declares it the next ‘Facebook Killer’ or ‘Twitter
Killer,’ arguing that within months, the corporate social media giant will be ‘killed’ because its users will leave en masse for the new alternative. Later, when someone notices that Facebook or Twitter is still active despite the presence of the ‘Killer,’ another journalist (or even the original journalist) will declare the alternative a ‘failure’ or simply ‘dead,’ mainly because it did not attract hundreds of millions of new users in a matter of weeks. The cycle appears to end—that is, until another alternative is noticed by a tech reporter, and the cycle is repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;em&gt;New Media and Society&lt;/em&gt; article provides citations, but here I’ll quickly cover some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2010, when diaspora* was getting attention, journalists declared it to be a “Facebook killer,” and soon after, declared it to be a failure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2014, ello was dubbed a Facebook killer, and then weeks later it was called a failure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And in 2017, the same happened to… Mastodon, which was dubbed a “Twitter Killer” only to be written off for dead that same year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see the same thing over the past few months with Mastodon coverage. In the fall, journalists asked me if Mastodon will replace Twitter. My typical reply was something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’ve seen massive discontent over corporate social media many times (e.g., Emotional Contagion, Cambridge Analytica) and somehow people keep using Facebook and Twitter et al. So, probably not, although if Twitter went away, I’d be fine with it. Regardless, what Mastodon and its kin offer is an alternative to corporate social media for those of us concerned about surveillance, disinformation, and harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, no matter what I said, the very emphasis on “will it replace Twitter?” is not too far off of “will it kill Twitter?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to last week, and WIRED’s Hoover asked me if I was concerned about the dropoff in Mastodon active users. I didn’t write down my exact reply, but I said something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No, because these waves come and go, and while some percentage of new users might stop using Mastodon, Mastodon’s overall membership has gone up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also stressed the fact that the real lesson of the Fall of 2022 was that ActivityPub succeeded in scaling up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/the-mastodon-bump-is-now-a-slump/&quot;&gt;resulting article&lt;/a&gt; is actually quite good. I commend Hoover for the article because it covered things like legal liability and the fact that the network did scale and because she interviewed a Mastodon admin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it does however imply that Mastodon is somehow failing because of the “slump.” It implies that Mastodon is dying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I know this because just a day after it came out, &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; reporter called to ask about Mastodon’s impending demise – and that reporter cited Hoover’s WIRED article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That second reporter was working on a story about… new and emerging alternatives to corporate social media. And they were starting with the premise that Mastodon failed and it was time to find something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, that reporter was looking for the next Killer Hype Cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-to-do-about-this-trope&quot;&gt;What to do about this trope?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d recommend to tech journalists covering alternative social media to push past the “Killer” trope and consider each alternative on its own terms, rather than strictly in opposition to a corporate counterpart. Yes, some comparison is inevitable – after all, we understand “alternative” in relation to a “mainstream.” But these are not 1:1 replacements – they have their own logics and cultures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, part of the appeal of the alternatives is the refusal of the growth logics of corporate social media. Mastodon admins, for example, don’t really want to run instances on the scale of Twitter. They want small instances that are more easily moderated at a human scale. Because of this, growth of Mastodon as a whole depends on the establishment of many new instances, which takes time and effort. As I say over and over, it’s not a matter of signing up at a central site, like Twitter.com. This is purposeful building of democratic social media, and growth is not always the best thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reporting in this space needs to focus on these nuances and eliminate the oversimplification “growth always equals good.” That’s hard to do when we’re conditioned by 20 years of corporate, venture capital, Silicon Valley thinking, but there is a world beyond the Valley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the rest of us in Mastodon and across the fediverse, I probably don’t need to say this, but I will, anyway: don’t be phased. Keep on doing what you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

Future posts to come.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As readers of the blog know by now, Goal 2 of the blog is &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/01/06/Goal2.html&quot;&gt;to document my writing of my next book&lt;/a&gt;, which I’m tentatively titling &lt;em&gt;Move Slowly and Build Bridges: Mastodon and the Struggle for Ethical Alternative Social Media&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, I have been studying the workings of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/Social/WG&quot;&gt;Social Web Working Group&lt;/a&gt; (SocialWG), a W3C standards group which ran from 2014 through 2017 and ultimately produced, among other things, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/&quot;&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt;, the protocol that underpins much of the fediverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figure I cannot tell any stories about Mastodon without understanding the production of ActivityPub. Looking through the SocialWG meetings, it’s quite clear that Mastodon and ActivityPub’s histories are deeply intertwined. Mastodon adopted ActivityPub it prior to AP being a Candidate Recommendation (the penultimate stage in the W3C recommendation process). Mastodon is also a key reason why the Social Web Working Group got a 6 month extension for their work in 2017 – see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/2017-06-27-minutes&quot;&gt;this meeting&lt;/a&gt;. They even set up a Mastodon instance (w3c.social) to show W3C members that software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post will discuss the early period of the SocialWG (circa 2014 through 2015). I’ll follow up later with more posts and notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, I need to offer a couple caveats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I didn’t participate in the group. Instead, I’m basing much of this off the meeting minutes, as well as blog posts by SocialWG members, and to a lesser extent on informal discussions and formal interviews with some of the members. It’s possible – likely, even – that I will get details wrong, not simply because I wasn’t there, but also because this poor English major was not trained in computer science. The notes here are things that caught my eye. If you have corrections or critiques of my interpretation, please do share in the comments! And, as I talk to more people, I might change my interpretations, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, my focus is predominantly going to be on ActivityPub. However, the SocialWG produced quite a few other standards. That said, in focusing on the group’s history, I should cover a lot of ground, even with my emphasis on ActivityPub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the meeting minutes are not verbatim transcripts (which makes sense – meeting minutes almost never are). They were taken by volunteers from among the SocialWG, who were trying to transcribe phone conversations while an IRC chat was going. So, any quotes I include here should not be taken as verbatim statements. In addition, given the sheer number of times I read statements such as “who’s speaking now?” and “I can hear weird noises” – these were largely telephone conferences, after all – I would take any attributions here with a major grain of salt, as well. Take, for example, the following exchange from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/2015-02-17-minutes&quot;&gt;this meeting&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;harry: so a cheapo understanding of heirarchy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… am confused when I read the spec&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;scribe: was that harry or dret ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;sorry if I set the wrong one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;dret: me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice in this example statements are attributed to harry when they were actually said by dret. So, I will tend to cite statements and ideas with minimal attribution unless I am 99% certain the statement can be attributed to the person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part--getting-started-getting-organized-2014-to-end-of-2015&quot;&gt;Part : Getting Started, Getting Organized (2014 to end of 2015)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-charter&quot;&gt;The Charter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first phase of a Working Group at the W3C is a Charter, and the Social Web Working Group is no exception. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2013/socialweb/social-wg-charter.html&quot;&gt;Their charter&lt;/a&gt; stated&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The Social Web Working Group will create &lt;strong&gt;Recommendation Track&lt;/strong&gt; deliverables that standardize a common JSON-based syntax for social data, a client-side API, and a Web protocol for federating social information such as status updates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, there are three goals (although one was actually optional, more on that in a bit):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A social syntax (what would ultimately become &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/&quot;&gt;Activity Streams 2.0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A client API&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A federation protocol&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the Charter connected the SocialWG to another group, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2013/socialweb/social-ig-charter.html&quot;&gt;Social Interest Group&lt;/a&gt;. As we’ll see in posts to come, the Social Interest Group played a key role by creating “user stories” that capture online social activities. Those stories would help structure the specifications the SocialWG would ultimately produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;organizational-issues&quot;&gt;Organizational Issues&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Charter, the Group began meeting, and the early meetings are marked by seemingly mundane and yet important issues, such as how teleconferencing works, how to take and post minutes, and when and where to meet in person. Those early meetings were about setting workflows and meeting schedules, including how the Draft and Recommendation process works at the W3C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These meetings also established/emphasized rules about who is allowed to participate in a Working Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-caught-my-eye&quot;&gt;What Caught My Eye&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so the first thing that I found fascinating was a desire for and fear of established social media corporations (specifically, Twitter, Google, Facebook). The SocialWG stated again and again that they wanted Facebook or Twitter to participate – here is but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/2015-09-29-minutes&quot;&gt;one example&lt;/a&gt; of such a discussion –  but there is also a strong fear of the work being appropriated or buried. Two things are often mentioned as cautionary tales: Schema.org and the Open Web Foundation. Obviously, the desire for and fear of corporate social media involvement relates to who can or should participate. And the lack of involvement from those corporations is really important for this history, I would think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also interesting to note that federation was bracketed off at this point. This is consistent with the Charter, which contemplated that Federation would be an optional deliverable: “Note that the Working Group may not develop the Federation Protocol into a Recommendation and it may become a Working Group Note.” Given that, from my perspective, the most important product of this group was the ActivityPub federation protocol, it’s remarkable that it almost didn’t get done because it was seen as optional. More on that in posts to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that caught my eye is that implementation and real-world examples were emphasized right away. The W3C specification process requires at least two implementations of every feature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Arnaud: Would like to remind people that as a part of the W3C spec track, there will be a point at which we have a call for implementations, at which point we need 2 implementations of &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; feature to move forward &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/2014-09-30-minutes&quot;&gt;(2014-09-30 meeting)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be very important in terms of the eventual ActivityPub and Mastodon. The first time we see much emphasis on implementation would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/2015-10-06-minutes&quot;&gt;when ActivityStreams 2.0 is set to move to Candidate Recommendation&lt;/a&gt; in late 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another fascinating aspect is that roughly a year into its existence, the SocialWG members would have a pretty heated debate about how to communicate. I tagged this in Zotero as “org comm,” short for “organizational communication,” or how an organization is constituted through its communicative practices. So, even though much time was spent early on in 2014 on how the group would get things done, communication conflicts emerged later on, with discussions about overloads in terms of channels and even flare-ups about who gets to speak when.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final note, but an important one. There are three distinct “camps” in the SocialWG:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An academic-focused group centered on SoLiD and semantic markup;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People with previous federation experience, such as Pump.io folks,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and IndieWeb, a group of folks who put the webpage at the center of everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll say more about these groups and their competing visions in future posts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="Goal 2" /><category term="ActivityPub" /><summary type="html">NB: This is the first in a series of posts where I will share my notes on my readings of the minutes of the Social Web Working Group.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-new-book-social-engineering&quot;&gt;A New Book: Social Engineering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My 2022 started out as ‘21 ended: I was the F. Jay Taylor Endowed Research Chair of Communication at Louisiana Tech. And at the start of 2022, I was eagerly awaiting the physical appearance of my third book. Co-authored with my good friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seanlawson.net/&quot;&gt;Sean Lawson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262543453/&quot;&gt;Social Engineering: How Crowdmasters, Phreaks, Hackers, and Trolls Created a New Form of Manipulative Communication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; tackles disinformation in the digital age. Sean and I drew on two histories of disinformation to tell the tale. First, there’s early 20th century propaganda (think of the work of Doris Fleischman, Edward Bernays, and Ivy Lee). Second, there’s mid-century phone and computer hacking (think of Suzy Thunder and Kevin Mitnick). We argue that today’s manipulation (think Russian election interference or deceptive marketing) is a mix of old-school propaganda and newer, interpersonal hacking. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://fossacademic.tech/2022/03/26/NewBookOldBook.html&quot;&gt;Here’s a longer summary if you’re interested&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough about that book, though. You’re probably wondering, “What software did you use to write it?” As I’ve written about here on the blog, Sean and I used a lot of FOSS to put this work together, including &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/10/05/deepdivezotero.html&quot;&gt;Zotero&lt;/a&gt; and Nextcloud. I was able to do much of my work at LaTech using Linux and LibreOffice, among other tools. So the FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream was in full effect for the composition of &lt;em&gt;Social Engineering.&lt;/em&gt; And! MIT Press also &lt;a href=&quot;https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/5281/Social-EngineeringHow-Crowdmasters-Phreaks-Hackers&quot;&gt;generously made the book Open Access&lt;/a&gt;, so open source is a theme here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the book is doing well. Sean and I presented it to various audiences, including Town Hall Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-next-book-move-slowly-and-build-bridges&quot;&gt;The Next Book: &lt;em&gt;Move Slowly and Build Bridges&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I have found myself doing when one book is wrapping up, I start looking around for the next project. And as &lt;em&gt;Social Engineering&lt;/em&gt; was nearing completion, I realized I already had a project: alternative social media. After all, I started this very blog with the vague idea of writing a book about FOSS. And many alternative social media projects are FOSS projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One such FOSS alternative in particular I had been watching for a few years: Mastodon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been studying alternative social media for many years – in fact, my dissertation and &lt;a href=&quot;https://tupress.temple.edu/books/reverse-engineering-social-media&quot;&gt;first book&lt;/a&gt; concluded with a call for alternatives, and I’ve been publishing about them ever since. At this point, early in 2022, it felt like a lonely area of study (although read on for more about this!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I started conceptualizing a book about Mastodon. And the more I looked at Mastodon, the more I learned how FOSS is much, much more complex than I had even realized. For example, how do we understand the fact that Mastodon was built predominantly by queer and trans folks, but that it was appropriated by white supremacists (in the form of Gab.com)? In other words, how do we understand the “freedom” in FOSS?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lightning bolt struck me when I came across the work of &lt;a href=&quot;https://where.coraline.codes/&quot;&gt;Coraline Ada Ehmke&lt;/a&gt;. I started studying her work on “&lt;a href=&quot;https://ethicalsource.dev/&quot;&gt;Ethical Source Software&lt;/a&gt;,” which is essentially FOSS for collective good. Rather than the absolute freedom of Freedom 0 – including the freedom to use software for destructive or unjust purposes – Ethical Source is about licensing software for use by anyone, but only for just purposes. It’s a radical project – radical in the best sense, in that it is getting to the root of problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the privilege of interviewing Ehmke to learn more. And all of it makes me wish I titled this blog something other than “fossacademic.tech”!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had the privilege of representing the Organization for Ethical Source at a Mastodon/Hometown workshop in Rotterdam in May of 2022. Conducted by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://varia.zone/en/&quot;&gt;Varia Collective&lt;/a&gt; (the good folks behind &lt;a href=&quot;https://post.lurk.org/about&quot;&gt;post.lurk.org&lt;/a&gt;), I participated in a masterclass in digital community building and moderation. I also talked to folks about the contradictions of FOSS – not only the issues of Freedom 0, but also issues around the devaluing of non-technical contributions and environmental impacts of digital media. I wrote a report for the OES on whether or not that organization should start its own Mastodon instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this has influenced my work on Mastodon. I worked with &lt;a href=&quot;https://cla.purdue.edu/directory/profiles/diana-zulli.html&quot;&gt;Diana Zulli&lt;/a&gt;, a political communication scholar at Purdue, to think about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2022.2147400&quot;&gt;non-centralized platform governance&lt;/a&gt;, ethics, and content moderation on Mastodon. The resulting paper is called “The Digital Covenant” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2022.2147400&quot;&gt;published version&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:49433/&quot;&gt;open access version&lt;/a&gt;). This work helped me think through &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the questions people like Ehmke are raising, but certainly not all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, I started &lt;a href=&quot;https://fossacademic.tech/2022/04/17/InterviewWorkflow.html&quot;&gt;interviewing Mastodon folks&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about its history, from its pre-cursors to ActivityPub to Playvicious to the prenent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What all this showed me is that things are even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; complicated! But also that there is a book in all this. It should be a fascinating book – I’ve tentatively titled it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Move Slowly and Build Bridges: Mastodon and the Struggle for Ethical Social Media.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And do not despair, fediverse friends: I will talk about the rest of the fediverse, too. I just need a main ‘character’ to do it, and Mastodon is it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-new-job-in-a-new-country&quot;&gt;A New Job in a New Country&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if starting a new book project wasn’t enough, I started a new job in a new country. In September, I moved North to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yorku.ca/&quot;&gt;York University&lt;/a&gt; in Toronto! I am so excited to be in Toronto, in Canada, and at York. Why? First, Toronto is not far from where I grew up in Michigan, and of course it’s an exciting city. Second, I’ve wanted to get to Canada for years now, especially since doing a Fulbright in Calgary. Third, I’ve admired York University – the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yorku.ca/laps/comn/&quot;&gt;Department of Communication and Media Studies&lt;/a&gt; in particular – for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Enough of that,” I hear you say. “Can you live the FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream at York?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is: yes, but it’s a bit harder than other places I’ve been. It’s a Microsoft shop, with Outlook and Teams running amok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I’m writing this post on a Linux box I was able to purchase through York with my startup funds. And I’ve been able to route emails and calendars from Outlook to Thunderbird. I can of course edit documents with LibreOffice – the compatibility with Word is solid. I just have to use Teams (and Zoom) on occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can live with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-research-gets-noticed&quot;&gt;My Research Gets Noticed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so all of that takes me through the early part of the year (the &lt;em&gt;Social Engineering&lt;/em&gt; book, starting a new book on Mastodon) and the middle bit (moving to York). What I would have liked is a quiet end to the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rumblings of a noisy end to 2022 started back in April, when a fellow named Musk offered to buy Twitter. That started a minor wave of folks who either started new Mastodon/fediverse accounts or revived dormant ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that wasn’t the big wave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late October, 2022: Musk completes the purchase. And the waves start coming. And they kept coming after Musk made weird choice after weird choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I have published work on Mastodon and other alternative social media, I had the privilege of talking to a lot of reporters at this time. I was interviewed about Musk, Twitter, and Mastodon by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/listen/live-radio/1-102-radio-noon-quebec/clip/15956335-why-care-happens-twitter&quot;&gt;CBC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketplace.org/shows/make-me-smart/unpacking-mastodon/&quot;&gt;Kai Ryssdal (of NPR Marketplace fame) and Kimberly Adams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-users-mastodon-meltdown/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;WIRED&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/ninetonoon/audio/2018866818/twitter-users-seek-alternative-to-musk-run-platform&quot;&gt;Radio New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, among other outlets. It was a wild time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also went to the annual Association of Internet Researchers conference in Dublin the midst of all this. As you can imagine, the hot topic was what to do if Twitter burns to the ground. &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/12/11/AOIR-social.html&quot;&gt;AOIR is now talking about starting its own Mastodon/Hometown instance&lt;/a&gt;. And several of the AOIR scholars who work on alternative social media are starting to plan projects together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this cements my idea that my next book should be about Mastodon. Indeed, it’s made me rethink that project – I don’t want to write it for academics. I want to write it for all the people who are deeply troubled by the fact that corporate social media can be dominated by billionaires, that we have no control over it, and that these systems are designed to exploit our sociality for profit. What the Musk wave taught me is that there are literally &lt;em&gt;millions&lt;/em&gt; of such people out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I no longer feel lonely in studying alternatives like Mastodon. In fact, I have the great privilege of connecting to people around the world who are thinking deeply about what social media means for our lives. Some of them have been on non-centralized, FOSS, democratically-run social media for years. Some are only now experimenting with these systems. But the conversation is now rich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in an effort to reach a broader audience, I’m now writing &lt;em&gt;Move Slowly and Build Bridges&lt;/em&gt; in a more accessible format. I will continue to blog about it here, and I will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2022/12/18/elon-musks-stance-on-free-speech-doesnt-include-competition-to-twitter.html&quot;&gt;write op-eds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/citizens-social-media-can-provide-an-antidote-to-propaganda-and-disinformation-192491&quot;&gt;other accessible publications&lt;/a&gt; about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also looking for a book agent for my next project. (Perhaps that’s you? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robertwgehl.org/&quot;&gt;Please contact me!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2023 is going to be an exciting year, I think!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="Goal 2" /><category term="Mastodon" /><category term="Goal 1" /><summary type="html">I don’t often do “Year in Review” posts, but… this past year has been something else.

He currently has four posts with more on the way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://roiskinda.cool/2022/11/recuerda-pv-chapter-1-the-start-part-1.html&quot;&gt;The Start, Part 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across Ro’s work while Playvicious was running sometime in 2018, and I made a note of it – and then forgot. I got distracted by a major project: my co-authored book on disinformation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262543453/&quot;&gt;Social Engineering&lt;/a&gt;. I put off my Mastodon/fediverse studies in order to understand social media and propaganda, especially in relation to US presidential elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I don’t regret diving into disinformation, I do regret not witnessing Playvicious’s run. It was an early, if not the first, Black-run instance on the fediverse. It was a source of joy for a lot of people. As Ro puts it, the idea of “play vicious” is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The energetic, unfiltered, sometimes uncomfortable, but the relentlessly progressive pursuit of understanding ourselves through creativity. It defined us as a group of thinking and feeling people who wanted to burn away all unnecessary details and get to the essence of why we loved what we loved and exist in that space for however long we could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that energy attracted some hate. As Ro will no doubt relate, Playvicious.social faced harassment and racism. Ro shut it down after watching as his moderators were traumatized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I missed its run online. And I really regret that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Ro (and others – I think more folks are starting to talk about PV) is giving all of us a great gift: an inside view of this most important Mastodon instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story Ro is telling is intensely personal. It’s also deeply important for the big questions of the fediverse, such as content moderation, how instances should relate to one another, and how societal injustices are replicated again and again online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Mastodon grows, a big stain has been not only the end of Playvicious.social, but also the experience of Black Mastodon members more generally. When people left Twitter after Musk’s takeover, it included the community known as Black Twitter. But Black Twitter ran into casual racism on the fediverse, and currently people are struggling to create #BlackMastodon. (I recommend following that hashtag and boosting posts).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, while PV.social is gone, Ro is not done. He’s building new software to this day, he hosts a microblog (a Misskey instance), and he’s contributing moderation tools to the fediverse – even in spite of all he and his colleagues went through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m grateful to Ro (and other PV folks) because I believe I cannot write my current book (Goal 2!) about Mastodon without talking about Playvicious.social. But it’s also not my story to tell. It’s Ro’s and other folks’ story. My job is to talk about it in the contexts that I can dig up through research and &lt;a href=&quot;https://fossacademic.tech/2022/04/17/InterviewWorkflow.html&quot;&gt;interviews&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The majority of scholarship on platform governance focuses on for-profit, corporate social media with highly centralized network structures. Instead, we show how non-centralized platform governance functions in the Mastodon social network. Through an analysis of survey data, Github and Discourse developer discussions, Mastodon Codes of Conduct, and participant observations, we argue Mastodon’s platform governance is an exemplar of the covenant, a key concept from federalist political theory. We contrast Mastodon’s covenantal federalism platform governance with the contractual form used by corporate social media. We also use covenantal federalist theory to explain how Mastodon’s users, administrators, and developers justify revoking or denying membership in the federation. In doing so, this study sheds new light on the innovations in platform governance that go beyond the corporate/alt-right platform dichotomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is also &lt;a href=&quot;https://hcommons.org/deposits/objects/hc:49434/datastreams/CONTENT/content&quot;&gt;available as a pre-print on H-Commons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He completed his purchase of Twitter &lt;em&gt;right before&lt;/em&gt; the annual meeting of the Association of Internet Researchers, held in Dublin in November of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coincidence? I think not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Musk takeover of Twitter prompted a conversation at AOIR’s meeting in Dublin in early November: should AOIR start a Mastodon (specifically, a Hometown) instance? As someone who has been advocating for alternative social media for years, I was all about this. Internet researchers have been among the first to recognize the perils of corporate social media. But of course, AOIR members often deeply engage online, which means using those systems for their pleasures and professional opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the old commercial says, there’s got to be a better way: a way to do social media but to do it on our terms. If the Musk takeover is the catalyst that pushes AOIR to adopt the fediverse, then as disturbing as things have gotten, at least there will be a positive outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spurred on by Aram Sinnreich, we started having informal discussions at AOIR’s 2022 meeting about starting up our own social media. What would it entail? How would we do it? The informal discussion involved some of my favorite AOIR folks: Nik John, Adrienne Massanari, Nick Couldry, Pat Aufderheide, and Esther Hammelburg (if I left anyone out, please let me know).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation went well but we all knew there was a lot of work ahead. Last week, I met with the AOIR Executive Committee to continue the work. They’ve agreed to my posting about this process to this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is meant to do two things. First, it documents how an academic association deliberates over whether and how to establish a presence on the fediverse. That ought to be useful for other organizations considering doing the same. I know there are quite a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, my hope is that by sharing AOIR’s deliberations, the rest of the fediverse can have some insight into our decision to proceed (should it come to that). Given that AOIR members engage in Internet Research, there may be trepidation about AOIR joining the fediverse – would AOIR come to the fedi to study it? To turn its users into objects of research?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put another way, will AOIR be a good organizational citizen of the fediverse? Will it host a well-moderated instance? Will it respect fediverse cultures and norms? Please read on, fedifriends. I hope that it’s clear AOIR is going to do it right – otherwise, AOIR is not going to do it at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tough-questions&quot;&gt;Tough Questions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meeting with AOIR Executive Committee went, in my view, extremely well, because they asked me the hardest questions. And for anyone starting a fediverse instance, I recommend asking similar questions. The questions included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do we spin up our own cloud server, a la Digital Ocean, or do we seek out managed hosting?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do we plan for our total membership to be involved (this year, 1000 people) or for a fraction of them?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do we block instances up front, or do we do so after bad actors appear?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Should we proceed if we can’t attract a pool of moderators?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do we deal with minor infractions of a code of conduct?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do we teach our members the ways of the fediverse – including the context-specific aspects of privacy and safety, especially in relation to research?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What would AOIR members get out of this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is: the conversation ended up answering these questions in the right way. The Executive Committee is on the right track, in my view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, we shouldn’t just spin up a DO droplet. We need managed hosting, because we do not have the expertise nor time to manage the backend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And our anticipated growth from a few dozen interested early adoptors to potentially our full 1000-person membership also suggests working with managed hosting, since managed hosts have the expertise to scale up resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes to blocking instances from the outset. Rather than reacting to fascist BS after it happens, block the fascists first. This is the advice I’m hearing from the experienced admins out there, and it sounds like AOIR is going to do it, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, we should not proceed if we can’t recruit moderators. First of all, having no moderators would send the wrong signal to the rest of the fediverse, namely that we are not serious about this. Second, if we can’t recruit moderators from our membership, then perhaps the membership isn’t showing enough interest in AOIR having an instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of moderation, minor infractions should not be a basis to boot people. Discussion is the best course. (For me, this is the promise of the fediverse: moderation at a human scale. It’s not easy, but at least we’re not under the illusion that AI can moderate, or that one moderator to 100K members is a good ratio). This is social media, after all, and it’s a new system. People will make minor mistakes. We need to be ready to help them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to the above, yes, we need to onboard our members. The fediverse isn’t Twitter. Moreover, AOIR is the group that produced Internet Research Ethics guides. And our ethics guides clearly state that Internet research needs to be very sensitive to context. The context of the fediverse, in my view, is that consent is ultra-important. That means lots of discussions with the membership about new research methods that take into account consent of the fediverse members. In my view, this will be the true struggle of an AOIR instance, and the way in which we address it will make it or break it. Because if we fail to respect the consent culture of the fediverse, our instance &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be isolated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, what would AOIR members get out of it? I mean, if you ask me, life beyond corporate social media is totally worth it. But the EC also suggests that this would allow for more communication among the membership – more opportunities for grad students and early researchers to connect with the senior researchers at AOIR. More opportunities to collaborate. More opportunities to share our work and celebrate it. And more cat pictures. Definitely more cat pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-to-come&quot;&gt;More to come&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation isn’t over, and that means more tough questions. But it’s a good sign that it’s the Executive Committee asking them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will post more as things develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;edit-for-credit&quot;&gt;Edit for Credit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t mention in the original post that Sarah T. Roberts, Aram, and I drafted a Code of Conduct for the Executive Committee ahead of the meeting. I want to acknowledge Sarah and Aram’s work on that document, too. I imagine we can share a draft of the COC with the fediverse, but for now we’re working on it in-house.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="Association of Internet Researchers" /><category term="Hometown" /><summary type="html">Elon Musk has crazy timing. He completed his purchase of Twitter right before the annual meeting of the Association of Internet Researchers, held in Dublin in November of this year. Coincidence? I think not. The Musk takeover of Twitter prompted a conversation at AOIR’s meeting in Dublin in early November: should AOIR start a Mastodon (specifically, a Hometown) instance? As someone who has been advocating for alternative social media for years, I was all about this. Internet researchers have been among the first to recognize the perils of corporate social media. But of course, AOIR members often deeply engage online, which means using those systems for their pleasures and professional opportunities. As the old commercial says, there’s got to be a better way: a way to do social media but to do it on our terms. If the Musk takeover is the catalyst that pushes AOIR to adopt the fediverse, then as disturbing as things have gotten, at least there will be a positive outcome. Spurred on by Aram Sinnreich, we started having informal discussions at AOIR’s 2022 meeting about starting up our own social media. What would it entail? How would we do it? The informal discussion involved some of my favorite AOIR folks: Nik John, Adrienne Massanari, Nick Couldry, Pat Aufderheide, and Esther Hammelburg (if I left anyone out, please let me know). The conversation went well but we all knew there was a lot of work ahead. Last week, I met with the AOIR Executive Committee to continue the work. They’ve agreed to my posting about this process to this blog. This post is meant to do two things. First, it documents how an academic association deliberates over whether and how to establish a presence on the fediverse. That ought to be useful for other organizations considering doing the same. I know there are quite a few. Second, my hope is that by sharing AOIR’s deliberations, the rest of the fediverse can have some insight into our decision to proceed (should it come to that). Given that AOIR members engage in Internet Research, there may be trepidation about AOIR joining the fediverse – would AOIR come to the fedi to study it? To turn its users into objects of research?

&lt;p&gt;This week I attended a &lt;a href=&quot;https://meedan.com/event/webinar-trust-and-safety-on-the-fediverse&quot;&gt;web seminar&lt;/a&gt; run by Darius Kazemi (creator of the Hometown fork of Mastodon), Kat Lo, a community moderator, and Aaron Huslage, a computer security professional. It was about Trust and Safety on the fediverse. The event was sponsored by Darius’s employer, Meedan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the webinar (or a version of it) will be available in video form. I will watch for it and post an update here when I see a link. For now, if you’re interested in content moderation, I’d strongly recommend watching out for a video version of the webinar – especially because of the Q and A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The webinar itself was quite a good overview of moderation on the fediverse, talking about blocking, muting and the like, so if you need to know more about that, it’s worth a watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But during the Q and A, I heard the most interesting stuff. Darius and others talked about a lot of emerging projects that might be worth investigating. For example, co-op moderation collectives, which would offer their moderation know-how to new fediverse instances. I don’t have specifics here, but this sounds fascinating! Also, Darius talked about forthcoming legal guides to running instances. Again, no specifics yet, but something to watch for.

I don’t know. None of us knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it appears you’re tearing Twitter apart. And this is driving people to Mastodon. I will talk about Mastodon at some other point – I am, of course, writing a book about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, I want to talk about the fall of Twitter and what I think it means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TL;DR version is: I don’t think Twitter was all that important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I keep hearing: what are we losing if Twitter goes away? This is asked in many different ways — are we losing a town square? Are we losing insight into how people socialize? Are we losing an archive of human history? Perhaps the clearest explanation of what Twitter may have meant comes from &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/what-the-world-would-lose-with-the-demise-of-twitter-valuable-eyewitness-accounts-and-raw-data-on-human-behavior-as-well-as-a-habitat-for-trolls-194601&quot;&gt;Anjana Susaria’s Conversation article.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, academics and journalists are mourning Twitter. But I would suggest that this moment is a good one to reconsider some very basic assumptions about that site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if instead of thinking of Twitter as a “town square,” maybe what’s really happening is &lt;em&gt;we are losing the conceit that a relatively small facet of human life has been conflated with a “town square” because the elites who use that system have declared it to be a town square?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if instead of a record of all human activity, &lt;em&gt;we are losing easy-to-gather datasets to make overly simple claims about sociality?&lt;/em&gt; And &lt;em&gt;what if all we are losing an archive that, were it to persist, would warp our conception of this period of history?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to downplay the importance of Twitter to your life – if it was important to you, that’s fine. Many people find community online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I am questioning is Twitter’s overall social utility. For every claim about the Arab Spring or Black Lives Matter (e.g., “how could social protest possibly happen without Twitter?!?”), let’s talk about governments using Twitter to monitor and dominate populations. For every claim about revealing previously unseen facets of social behavior, let’s talk about how Twitter reduces us to a small set of social verbs – so small, in fact, that socialbots can successfully mimic our behavior in the site. For all the claims about “the archive,” let’s not forget that this system was designed to get us to declare our likes and desires, generate data about those things, and sell us back to ourselves qua commodities. Some archive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, anyone who knows my work for the past decade will probably not be surprised that I am dismissive of doom-and-gloom over Twitter’s loss. I’ve been calling for people to leave sites like Twitter for over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even if it survives – and it may just – let’s take this moment to stop elevating it to a status that it really doesn’t deserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;post-script-on-donald-trump&quot;&gt;Post-Script: On Donald Trump&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I write this, the news just broke that Musk will let the insurrectionist Donald Trump back onto the site. Again, here is exactly what I’m talking about: because media elites have relied on Twitter, it is only right and proper that Trump is brought back so we can have access to his contributions to the “town square.” Frankly, this is utterly insane. He. Tried. To. Become. The. Dictator. Of. The. World’s. Biggest. Military. Power. The idea that we have to debate issues with him and his ilk in a corporate website is bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;

I argue that the authors get “alternative social media “ wrong. I lay out some of my concerns in that&lt;/em&gt; Conversation &lt;em&gt;piece, but I only had about 900 words to work with.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this longer blog post, I wanted to give more context for what I’m saying, especially because the Pew report is pretty good work, with the definitional exception. Here I want to explain a bit about &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; Pew researchers can say “alternative social media” and only refer to exerable sites like Gab and Parler.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post will also be the skeleton for some upcoming talks I’m going to give, one at the Association of Internet Researchers and another at Malmö University.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.routledge.com/Right-Wing-Alternative-Media/Holt/p/book/9781032338200&quot;&gt;Right-Wing Alternative Media&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; Kristoffer Holt argues that scholarship on alternative media has largely ignored right-wing alternatives. This is because scholars tend to draw on critical theory (particularly Gramscian hegemony theory) and then go on to seek out resistance to mainstream media and ideas. This explains the emphasis on alternative media practices, such as those associated with the Zapatistas, the anti-globalization movement and Indymedia, and later the media practices of Occupy Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, however, the situation is flipped on its head. Currently, scholarship focusing on a new form of alternative media – alternative social media – overly emphasize right-wing platforms. For example, the Pew Research center just released a report, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2022/10/06/the-role-of-alternative-social-media-in-the-news-and-information-environment/&quot;&gt;“The Role of Alternative Social Media in the News and Information Environment.”&lt;/a&gt; Its somewhat generic name covers up a great deal of specificity: when the authors say “the news and information environment,” they are specifically referring to American media. More importantly (at least to me!), when they say “alternative social media,” they are referring only to specific sites: BitChute, Gab, Gettr, Parler, Rumble, Telegram and Truth Social.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know anything about these sites, you know that they are dominated by far-right users. Gab, for example, is rife with racist, transmisic content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it’s a notable example, the Pew Report isn’t the only example of scholarship reducing “alternative social media” to what ought to be called (following Holt’s work)  “right-wing alternative social media.” I’ve seen multiple academic papers making the same move. In fact, I’m increasingly exasperated to find that “alternative social media” increasingly &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; means right-wing social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter? Especially when most everyone is not using “alternative social media” – there are far, far more people on what I call “corporate social media,” such as Facebook and Twitter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It matters because this focus on right-wing platforms as the only alternative creates a very false dichotomy. On the one hand, we have corporate social media, which (in comparison to the right-wing ASM) are moderated. On the other, we have right-wing, alternative social media, which are either unmoderated (in the case of Gab) or simply attract and tolerate fascists or fascist-adjacent members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This false dichotomy completely misses a major innovation in alternative social media: ethical, moderated, noncentralized, and democratically-controlled alternative social media. For clarity’s sake, I’ll adopt a term from Clemencia Rodríguez and call these “Citizens’ Social Media.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-this-happens&quot;&gt;Why this happens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I talk about Citizens’ Social Media, let me explain how I think “alternative social media” has come to mean only right-wing social media. I see three reasons for this: the alt-right, the fact that right-wing alternative social media are easy for journalists and researchers to understand, and poor moderation by corporate social media sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-alt-right&quot;&gt;The Alt-Right&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One big reason, in my view, is the rise of the Alt-Right. The name alone gives us a clue. While there’s debate about what the Alt-Right is, based on my observations (and with the caveat that I am largely speaking of the American context), I would suggest the Alt-Right is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wwnorton.com/books/9781631495731&quot;&gt;White Christian Nationalist&lt;/a&gt; political grouping that is opposed both to the contemporary Left as well as both the neoliberal and neoconservative Right which has been dominant for the past 40 years. The Alt-Right is racist, misogynist, antisemitic, Islamophobic, and transphobic, drawing on these bigotries to oppose any political economic programs that do not benefit cisgender, Christian white men. That much is true of the Right in general, but the Alt-Right is also opposed to the libertarianism of the neoliberals: rather than calling for small government, the Alt-Right seeks to expand the power of the state to regulate sexuality, religious, and racial hierarchies. The Alt-Right is also opposed to neoconservatism in the sense that it is against global capitalism (and the attendant warmongering that transnational capitalism requires) in favor of isolationism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an alternative to the neoliberal/neocon Right, the Alt-Right needs to develop its own discourse and media system. Hence the rise of sites like Gab and Truth Social. Following the lead of political figures like Donald Trump, Ron Desantis, and Marjorie Taylor Green – and with a heavy dose of TV journalism from FOX News and OAN, these sites have helped Alt-Righters develop their disinformation narratives about the democratic process in America (e.g., “Stop the Steal” and the lie about 2020) as well as efforts to reduce the damage of COVID-19 (e.g., the vaccine is full of nanobots made by Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci at the behest of the Chinese government).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is where Kristoffer Holt’s work on right-wing alternative media is valuable: with his work in mind, I’m quite confident we can call Gab et al “right-wing alternative social media.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;right-wing-alternative-social-media-are-easy-to-understand&quot;&gt;Right-wing alternative social media are easy to understand&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason why “alternative social media” has been reduced to right-wing social media is, in part, because right-wing social media &lt;em&gt;look like&lt;/em&gt; Facebook and Twitter. What I mean by this is that sites like Gab and Truth are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;centralized (they have a single domain, such as Gab.com),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;they feature singular, founding personalities (e.g., Trump and Truth Social, Andrew Torba and Gab),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;they are for-profit enterprises, exploiting the activities of their users through marketing, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we can do social things with them, such as posting media, liking, and following.
So, for researchers and journalists, these systems are only different – they are only “alternative” – in that they harbor right-wing racists and misogynists, the aforementioned alt-right. In all other respects, they are easy to understand (unlike Citizens’ Social Media, as I will describe below). That makes them easier to research and write about, especially when facing a deadline or bewildered peer reviewers. (I could tell you stories upon stories about dealing with peer reviewers that think Mastodon is the same as Reddit.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;poor-moderation-practices-in-corporate-social-media&quot;&gt;Poor moderation practices in corporate social media&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part and parcel of the rise of Alt-Right, right-wing alternative media is legitimate criticism of the big, corporate platforms, such as Meta/Facebook and Twitter. Due to their well-documented faults in content moderation due to their massive scale, anyone of us can fault them for uneven, incoherent, or confusing moderation practices. (I myself was locked out of Twitter for… reasons. I don’t know why).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when entire industries have grown around monetizing audience attention, deplatforming for any reason can harm the incomes of people. Influencers, sex workers, or provocateurs who build personal brands in corporate social media can see their brand values eroded instantly by a deplatforming or shadowbanning decision made by some algorithm or poorly-informed and overworked content moderator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, a big event here was the well-deserved (albeit much too late) banning of Donald Trump from Facebook and Twitter after January 6. That drove many people to sites like Gab, which had been promising to protect free speech, or Trump’s latest grift, Truth Social, which doesn’t so much promise free speech as it promises to coddle Trumpers. These very, very notable deplatforming incidents lead &lt;a href=&quot;https://knightcolumbia.org/content/deplatforming-our-way-to-the-alt-tech-ecosystem&quot;&gt;Ethan Zuckerman and Chand Rajendra-Nicolucci to argue that deplatforming has lead to the “alt-tech” space&lt;/a&gt; – the sorts of social media. cloud hosting, payment systems, and the like that the alt-right is building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;im-not-saying-stop-studying-gab&quot;&gt;I’m not saying stop studying Gab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above leads to the totally understandable focus on right-wing alternative social media. Frankly, we &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; scholarship on these media, so I hope that no one sees my argument as “we need to stop talking about Gab.” No: study and report on Gab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just stop implying that it is the only alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;instead-im-saying-there-are-more-alternatives-citizens-social-media&quot;&gt;Instead, I’m saying there are more alternatives: Citizens’ Social Media&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we reduce “alternative social media” to “right-wing social media,” we end up with a vision of alternative that doesn’t strike me as all that alternative. We end up with a vision that is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;of centralized, for-profit services that&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;monetize audience behavior through selling data to advertisers and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;encourage similar growth logics among their users, as well as&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;foster white supremacists and fascists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we that far from Facebook here? Following Holt, if we need nuance in talking about “alternative media” in order to distinguish right-wing from other forms, we also need such nuance in speaking of other types of alternative social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where I am inspired by Clemencia Rodriguez’s concept of “citizens’ media” – media that are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;democratically controlled,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;liberatory and just,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;decentralized (or, as she puts it, “power is fragmented”)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;raise the consciousness and critical abilities of their producers and audiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote about such social media in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2056305115604338&quot;&gt;Social Media + Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; back in 2015. There, I made the same/opposite mistake Pew made: I called such social media “alternative social media” without accounting for the right-wing alternatives that were starting to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m working hard to correct that mistake by thinking about Citizens’ Social Media. I have more to do here, but I can say that such social media do exist and have actively opposed right-wing social media. I see this in many sites on the fediverse. They are well-moderated, relying on community decision-making to foster safety and debate. They do not rely on surveillance capitalism. They are more transparent at both social and technical levels. And while each instance is small, they can band together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem the fediverse faces is, after 2 decades of “social media” meaning centralized, for-profit organizations headed by personalities (e.g., Zuckerberg), networks of small, federated social media that are not-for-profit is just too hard to explain or understand. Social media that looks just like Twitter and has a bunch of right-wing goons, however, is easy to understand and is easily labeled “alternative.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we now find ourselves in the opposite space Holt discusses: we need scholarship that nuances “alternative” by focusing on Left alternatives: Citizens’ social media. In fact, this is what my current book project – Goal 2 of this blog – is all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="alternative social media" /><category term="Goal 2" /><summary type="html">NB: I just published a piece in_ The Conversation _about a recent Pew Research report, “The Role of Alternative Social Media in the News and Information Environment”.

In this longer blog post, I wanted to give more context for what I’m saying, especially because the Pew report is pretty good work, with the definitional exception. Here I want to explain a bit about why Pew researchers can say “alternative social media” and only refer to exerable sites like Gab and Parler.

But unfortunately, it’s a deeply problematic one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobre et al’s “More of the Same? A Study of Images Shared on Mastodon’s Federated Timeline” is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-19097-1_11&quot;&gt;paper that is now published&lt;/a&gt; in proceedings from &lt;em&gt;International Conference on Social Informatics.&lt;/em&gt; (Unfortunately, it’s not open access.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I’m currently researching the fediverse and blogging about that process, I thought I’d write up notes on this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why this paper? Frankly, because I’m pretty certain it violates the community norms, as well as terms of service, of many Mastodon instances. It instantly reminded me of the controversial paper from Zignani et al, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/3262/3130&quot;&gt;“Mastodon Content Warnings: Inappropriate Contents on a Microblogging Platform”&lt;/a&gt;, which resulted in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sunclipse.org/wp-content/downloads/2020/01/open-letter.html&quot;&gt;scathing open letter&lt;/a&gt; and the retraction of a dataset from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/R1HKVS&quot;&gt;Harvard Dataverse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobre et al’s “More of the Same” is a study of image-sharing. The authors claim that it is about image-sharing on Mastodon, but really their focus is on images they culled from Mastodon.social’s federated timeline. They pulled 4M posts from 103K active users, of which 1M had images. Since they pulled posts from Mastodon.social’s federated timeline, they saw posts from 4K separate instances. The authors state that a “relevant number” of the images they found are “explicit.” They categorize the images as such after running them through Google’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/vision&quot;&gt;Vision AI&lt;/a&gt; Safe Search system. They also run the images they find through Google’s image search to trace where the images came from and how they are shared on Mastodon. Ultimately, the authors don’t really make an argument, other than stating in passing that Mastodon needs better moderation, since people share explicit images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, “More of the Same” lives up to its title: it’s more of the same poor scholarship that can be seen in Zignani et al (in fact, Nobre et al cite that controversial paper). Here are my critiques:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;key-problems-in-more-of-the-same&quot;&gt;Key Problems in “More of the Same”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;violations-of-community-standards-and-privacy-policies&quot;&gt;Violations of Community Standards and Privacy Policies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the big one. There has been a longstanding community prohibition against taking Mastodon posts out of context. This is something I have observed again and again as I do my participant observation in the fediverse. While many Mastodon users might be ok with having their posts taken, many are not. And many instances prohibit the practice in their terms of service. I myself am very careful about getting explicit consent from anyone I want to quote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did the authors examine the privacy policies or terms of service for all – or even any – of the 4K instances they culled content from? There’s no indication that they did. Indeed, unlike Zignani et al, these authors don’t even discuss privacy. The assumption seems to be that these posts are “public” and are thus fair game. But as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aoir.org/reports/ethics3.pdf&quot;&gt;Association of Internet Researcher’s ethics guidelines&lt;/a&gt; have noted over the years, sometimes “public” doesn’t mean “public” – that is, it doesn’t mean “I want everyone in the world to see this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And most egregious is the fact that there is no human subjects/institutional review board information in the paper – it doesn’t even appear that the authors took that basic step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-consented-to-be-analyzed-by-google&quot;&gt;Who Consented to be Analyzed by Google?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s no indication that people consented to having their posts scraped, there’s &lt;strong&gt;definitely&lt;/strong&gt; no indication that they consented to have their posts submitted to Google. But the authors do exactly that – twice. They ran images through Google’s Vision AI and also through Google’s image search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many of the 4K instances seek to avoid being indexed by Google? I’m actually not sure, but I have seen people discuss using robots.txt and other means to avoid having “public” posts be indexed. Regardless, exporting content from Mastodon into Google’s indexes violates community norms, if not terms of service for many instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-explicit-and-in-what-context&quot;&gt;What is “explicit?” And in what context?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors run images through Google safe search and find that a “relevant number” of them “may be explicit” – that they might have nudity, or violence, or are spoof images. The assumption here is that Google is the arbitor of explicitness online. Maybe Google is, maybe it isn’t, but one key aspect is missing: context. Are they porn images? Are they medical images? What context are they embedded in? Much like the “public” aspect discussed above, I have observed over and over again Fediverse users saying that they don’t want their posts taken out of context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the authors note a number of the images are “spoof” images, per the Google analysis, and that spoof images are explicit. How so? Indeed, what does “spoof” even mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, none of this accounts for the fact that Mastodon (and other fediverse sites) use content warnings and other devices to allow users a bit of control over what they see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, the observation that there are explicit images led the authors to make a rather weak, in-passing argument “moderation is necessary in the Mastodon environment as images, while being a popular media format, indeed display a consistent level of explicit content” (page 189). But again, without context, these authors cannot really judge whether or not the “Mastodon environment” is moderated or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-top-ten-image-sharing-mastodon-instance-is-actually-a-pleroma-instance&quot;&gt;A top-ten image sharing Mastodon instance is actually a Pleroma instance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors don’t publish a list of all the 4K instances they scraped content from, but they do post the Top Ten image-sharing instances. Given that they scrape Mastodon.social’s federated timeline, it’s no surprise that that instance is #1. There are also other, unsurprising inclusions on the top ten: botsin.space (#2), mastodon.online (#6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a surprising #3, though: milker.cafe. The authors talk about milker.cafe at length, because they note that milker.cafe’s 11 active users contributed a whopping 26K images to the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is milker.cafe is a Pleroma instance, not a Mastodon one. Since they make claims about Mastodon not being moderated enough, this is a bit of a problem. I hadn’t heard of milker.cafe, so I took a look and got – surprise, surprise – eyeballs full of busty waifus… once I clicked through the “Adults Only” warnings. How many of Nobre et al’s “explicit” instances came from milker.cafe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And why didn’t the authors flag this Top Ten image sharing site as a Pleroma instance, not a Mastodon one? Could they not tell the difference?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-denominator-problem&quot;&gt;The Denominator Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the authors note that the largest instances share the most “explicit” images. This raises the denominator problem (as Eric Jardine might put it): they don’t offer any denominator, so we have no idea what percentage we’re dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a whole, the paper,&lt;/strong&gt; in my opinion, violates Mastodon community norms without really contributing much of anything to science. The authors’ key findings are a) people share images on Mastodon; that b) many of those images come from outside of Mastodon (e.g., Twitter, Reddit); and c) some of those images are – in the judgement of Google’s Safe Search algorithm – explicit. Therefore, they argue, Mastodon needs moderation. As I see it, the authors are relying on an age-old trick to get published: gin up a moral panic about some new digital media practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I  don’t think that these simplistic findings required such a breach of community norms and privacy policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-to-do&quot;&gt;What to do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is: beyond my critiquing this paper, what do we do? I mentioned this paper on scholar.social and people have floated the idea of another open letter, similar to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sunclipse.org/wp-content/downloads/2020/01/open-letter.html&quot;&gt;one sent about Zignani et al&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But would it be effective? I took a look at the previous open letter and note that many of the remedies requested haven’t been achieved. While Harvard’s Dataverse did pull the Zignani et al dataset, the paper itself remains published and unretracted. Unlike the case of Zignani et al, Nobre et al appear to have not posted their dataset anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Zignani et al, however, Nobre et al don’t mention privacy considerations. It could be that an open letter to their institutions (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais and Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto) &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; result in these institutions’ ethics boards to take a look at the work of Nobre et al. And since Nobre et al discuss future research plans involving media scraping from Mastodon, an open letter might prompt these researchers to do better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;addendum&quot;&gt;ADDENDUM&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fellow Mastodon member noted that &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/preferences/&quot;&gt;there is an option in Mastodon for users to avoid being indexed by search engines&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, I have it set on my account. So, for anyone whose posts were included in the Nobre et al study, they have been indexed by Google without their consent.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="Mastodon" /><category term="Research Ethics" /><summary type="html">There’s a new paper out about Mastodon!
