That’s the program where I earned my PhD, so it was an honor to come back and talk to my professors as well as some of the new students currently in the program.</p>

<p>I took the presentation as an opportunity to reflect on my academic career from my time at Mason (2005-2010) to my <a href="/2024/02/11/Move-Slowy-Preview.html">latest book project</a>. I’ve modified it for this blog. Take a look at the abstract and, if piques your interest, feel free to read it! (It’s a bit long.)</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>In my time as a PhD student in GMU’s Cultural Studies program, I learned
that I must let my object of study tell me what methods to use to
analyze it. I also learned not to merely interpret the object, but seek
to change it. Since I chose to study what was then called “Web 2.0” and
what I now call “corporate social media,” I needed to bring Marxian
political economy, science and technology studies, and software studies
to bear on the object. And I began to examine the practices of activists
who sought to make something better than corporate social media:
alternative social media. Over a decade ago I began my adventures in
alternative social media, chasing it through hacker collectives,
cyberlibertarian organizations, and even onto the dark web. Through
digital ethnography, close examinations of code, and hands-on experience
running alternative social media, I developed an approach I call
“critical reverse engineering.” Here I present critical reverse
engineering as a methodology for activist engagement with digital
technologies. To illustrate this approach, I will draw on insights from
my forthcoming book, <em>Move Slowly and Build Bridges: Mastodon, the
Fediverse, and the Struggle for Ethical Social Media</em> (Oxford, 2025).</p>

<h2 id="introduction-do-we-call-it-x-or-twitter">Introduction: Do we call it X or Twitter?</h2>

<p>Is it X? Or is it Twitter?</p>

<p>Because I’ve heard media critics use both names, even well after Musk bought
Twitter in 2022.</p>

<p>I hear media critics say, “X is out of control. It’s full of
disinformation and pornbots. Musk is slowly destroying it, indicating
the fundamental problem of billionaires owning social media.”</p>

<p>And then, I often hear those same media critics tell their readers and
listeners, “Please follow me on Twitter.”</p>

<p>It’s “X” when you hate it and “Twitter” when you love it.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/democracynow.webp" alt="A screenshot of the Democracy Now website, showing stories critical of Elon Musk, yet allowing you to share the story on Musk's X." />
    <figcaption>
        While Democracy Now! is critiquing Elon Musk, they still contribute to his bottom line by using Musk's X.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This screenshot of <em>Democracy Now!</em> doesn’t quite illustrate my point,
but it gets close. Here are stories about billionaire media owners – including Elon Musk – who run
amok. But please do follow us on the very platforms we decry.</p>

<p>This encapsulates the contradictions of corporate social media: we may
complain about them, about surveillance capitalism, exploitation of our
sociality, algorithms that push content on us, about addiction.</p>

<p>And yet we also believe they are the only tool we have to speak up, to
organize, or more humbly, to connect and share with our friends.</p>

<h3 id="leaving-corporate-social-media">Leaving Corporate Social Media</h3>

<p>In contrast, my career has largely been dedicated to the idea that we
can and must leave corporate social media behind. That we can maintain
their pleasures while effectively taking them over. For over a decade now, I’ve been talking to activists and technologists seeking to make something better than X or Facebook.</p>

<p>This presentation is a bit of a reflection on my academic career and how I came to study alternative social media. It starts with my time in Cultural Studies at Mason (2005-2010), then the
period around the writing of my first book, <a href="https://tupress.temple.edu/books/reverse-engineering-social-media"><em>Reverse Engineering Social
Media</em></a> a decade ago, and culminating in my current book, <em>Move Slowly
and Build Bridges,</em> which should come out next year.</p>

<p>My plan for this is roughly chronological:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Part 1: Cultural Studies and Web 2.0</li>
  <li>Part 2: Seeking Critical Reverse Engineers</li>
  <li>Part 3: Adventures in Alternative Social Media</li>
  <li>Part 4: New Critical Reverse Engineers on the Fediverse</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="part-1-gmu-cultural-studies-web-20-2005--2010">Part 1: GMU Cultural Studies, Web 2.0 (2005 – 2010)</h2>

<p>Thinking back, what I learned during my time in the Cultural Studies PhD progam at Mason were two lessons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, what does the object of study need you to do to understand
it? How does the object demand particular methodologies?</li>
  <li>Second, “<a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/theses/theses.htm">the point is to change it</a>.” That is, the point of our work is to make a better world.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="finding-an-object-web-20">Finding an Object: Web 2.0</h3>
<p>First I needed an object of study.</p>

<p>I came to the object of my study during a class with GMU Cultural Studies professor <a href="https://historyarthistory.gmu.edu/people/alandsb1">Alison Landsberg</a>.
She said, “someone ought to take a look at Youtube,” in her Visual Cultures class.</p>

<p>At the time, YouTube was making headlines because of its eye-popping <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna15196982">sale to Google for $1.65 billion USD</a>.</p>

<p>Like many people, professor Landsberg was perhaps wondering how a relatively obscure website could be sold for such a sum. Prior to Google’s purchase, YouTube was best known as a place where people either <a href="https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2799/2577">uploaded pirated videos</a> or made “vlogs,” personal, self-confessional
video blogs (as well as “vlogs” that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonelygirl15">turned out to be fictional, yet compelling</a>).</p>

<p>The users had made YouTube what it was – contributing videos, commenting on them, building a culture. Were they getting a cut of the $1.65 billion?</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/battelleoreilly.jpg" alt="John Battelle and Tim O'Reilly at the Web 2.0 summit" />
    <figcaption>
        John Battelle and Tim O'Reilly at the Web 2.0 summit. My understanding is that we may be on Web3 now. Or Web 4.0. Or Web 10.0. I'm not even sure anymore.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The case of YouTube led me to what at the time was called <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/pub/a/web2/archive/what-is-web-20.html">Web 2.0</a>, where, as Tim
O’Reilly and John Batelle argued in 2004, users of digital technologies do the work of building businesses. Where users create data – about the world, and about themselves – that companies can harvest for new ideas and profit.</p>

<p>Were Youtube’s users getting a cut, then? No. From a note I took around the time, I wrote “These companies ask us to build them, and then expect us to consume their products, without compensation beyond a ‘richer’ user experience.”</p>

<p>And of course I wasn’t the first to say this – <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/social-text/article-abstract/18/2%20(63)/33/33433/Free-LaborPRODUCING-CULTURE-FOR-THE-DIGITAL?redirectedFrom=fulltext">Tiziana Terranova had already theorized free labor</a> in digital media, and <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-review-of-social-history/article/emerging-sources-of-labor-on-the-internet-the-case-of-america-online-volunteers/56D287B6007BCF167FC254EF4ED166CF">many others</a> had taken
up that concept.</p>

<p>Now of course many people recognize what’s going on, and call this “surveillance capitalism.” It’s an idea so recognizable that even the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/09/ftc-staff-report-finds-large-social-media-video-streaming-companies-have-engaged-vast-surveillance">US Federal Trade Commission has just now noticed it happening</a>!</p>

<p>Welcome to the party, FTC. We’ve been talking about this since the 2000s.</p>

<h3 id="methods-marxian-political-economy-science-and-technology-studies-and-software-studies">Methods: Marxian political economy, science and technology studies, and software studies</h3>

<p>So my object became Web 2.0, or surveillance capitalism, or specifically what I now call <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2056305115604338">corporate social media</a>.</p>

<p>What methods could I bring to bear?</p>

<p>These are digital technologies and they involve communicative practices, and they are embedded deeply in capitalism. They rely upon user-generated content – that is, freely given labor – to produce valuable digital artifacts that attract attention.</p>

<p>The object spoke, and one thing it said to me was “use Marxian political economy to understand me.” <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/">Marx’s <em>Grundrisse</em></a> turned out to be valuable – particularly as <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0950238032000114868">Stuart Hall</a>] and <a href="https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=p067952">Nick Dyer-Witheford</a> had interpreted it.</p>

<p>The object also told me to use science and technology studies – particularly conceptions of heterogeneity found in the work of <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/book/2030/ComplexitiesSocial-Studies-of-Knowledge-Practices">John Law and and
Annemarie Mol</a>.</p>

<p>And because Web 2.0 relies on software, I also turned to <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262062749/software-studies/">software studies</a> to help understand the underlying digital and material layers of Web 2.0. In particular, I turned to analysis of software engineering as a practice, especially the <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/social-text/article/30/2%20(111)/99/33725/Real-Software-AbstractionsOn-the-Rise-of-Facebook">specific ideas of abstraction</a> in software engineering.</p>

<p>Together, the above gave me conceptual tools to decompose Web 2.0 – what I now would call “corporate social media” – and engage in a critical approach to technology, using concepts such as <em>labor, value, exploitation, abstraction</em>, and <em>engineering</em>.</p>

<h3 id="the-point-is-to-change-it">The Point is to Change It</h3>

<p>But, taking a cue from <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/22860236">Andrew Feenberg</a>, it is not simply enough to
decompose the object with concepts.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2470750">I write elsewhere</a> (basically paraphrasing Feenberg), “Rather than
start with an ideal and bemoaning a world that doesn't live up to it, critical theory seeks out contradictions within the objects it
encounters. These fissures provide us with tangible ways forward, new possibilities that are not simply abstract, timeless ethical ideals.”</p>

<p>Again: this is the other lesson I received from my time at Mason. The point is to change it.</p>

<p>But how could I help change it? I was an English major. Particularly back during my PhD studies, I was not skilled in coding. I was not (and largely still am not) “technical.”</p>

<p>But I could look for people – activists, technologists – who were challenging the rising corporate domination of the internet.</p>

<h2 id="part-2-seeking-critical-reverse-engineers-2008--2014">Part 2: Seeking Critical Reverse Engineers (2008 – 2014)</h2>

<p>My PhD studies led me to the study of people I call “critical reverse engineers,” activists who are taking apart the technologies we face, learning how
they work, and building better systems.</p>

<p>First, I’ll say a bit more about how I’m thinking about critical reverse engineering. Examining the technical literature on reverse engineering, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2470750">I argue</a> that
a critical form of reverse engineering involves the four following orientations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pragmatic</li>
  <li>Genealogical</li>
  <li>Legal</li>
  <li>Normative</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-pragmatic-orientation">The Pragmatic Orientation</h3>

<p>Reverse engineers do not imagine an ideal technology. Instead, they start with existing technical objects, taking them apart to see how they
have been constructed.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/hacf_re.jpg" alt="A scene from the TV show Halt and Catch Fire. Two men are in a garage. They are looking into an open computer." />
    <figcaption>
        In Season 1 of the AMC show Halt and Catch Fire, two characters reverse engineered an IBM PC to make a new computer.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A scene from the AMC show <em>Halt and Catch Fire</em> illustrates this. A
two-person team set out to make a new computer called The Giant. Instead
of building the ideal machine, they simply reverse-engineered the IBM PC
to make a PC clone.</p>

<p>As that scene illustrates, a great deal of this process entails the
discovery of 'facts' discerned through thick, close, detailed
empirical analysis of technical objects. How does the technology work?
What is it comprised of? Who built it? What might their intentions have
been? What can we do with it?</p>

<h3 id="genealogical">Genealogical</h3>

<p>Drawing on Foucauldian thinking, particularly as interpreted by <a href="https://iupress.org/9780253006233/genealogy-as-critique/">Colin Koopman</a>,
I argue that there is a genealogical aspect to reverse engineering.</p>

<p>That is, “reverse engineering” is “forward engineering” in reverse. Engineering typically is a process of developing abstract requirements,
then specification documents, and then the specifications are implemented in material.</p>

<p>Reverse engineering starts with the implemented object and then moves backward towards abstract conceptions that may have preceded.</p>

<p>In addition, a reverse engineer engages in what <a href="https://noehernandezcortez.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/nietzsche-genealogy-history.pdf">Foucault might call</a> the “gray, meticulous, and patiently documentary” work of poring through comments in code, scrounging for specification documents, or studying the discourses of the organization that created the object under scrutiny.</p>

<h3 id="legal">Legal</h3>

<p>The familiar caveat: I am not a lawyer!</p>

<p>But, according to legal scholars who look at reverse engineering – particularly <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/article/the-law-and-economics-of-reverse-engineering">Pamela Samuelson</a> – reverse engineering has a tradition of legal protections in contexts such as the United States and the European Union. In traditional manufacturing, U.S. courts have held that the sale of an object is akin to its publication, and thus the legal owner of any object is free to take it apart, study it, and even produce a copy of it for sale.</p>

<p>This situation is a bit more complex with software. Lines of code are protected by copyright; I cannot copy lines of code from a
copyrighted program into a new program. But in terms of the functional side, unless it has been protected by a patent, we are free to replicate
the functionality of existing software. And in order to do that, we are in fact allowed to open up, probe, test, and disassemble software –
even to make copies of it in the process.</p>

<h3 id="normative">Normative</h3>

<p>However, none of the above is necessarily critical. Someone can reverse engineer a technology merely to make a competing product.</p>

<p>To become “critical reverse engineering,” we need a critical, normative approach – we need ethics. That is, we disassemble technical artifacts, produce knowledge from that disassembly, and construct new artifacts that further efforts towards economic and social justice.</p>

<p>So I have been seeking activists engaged in critical reverse engineering of corporate social media – people who are pragmatic in their relation to technology, use genealogical thinking, exercise their rights to reverse engineer, and do so to make a better world.</p>

<h2 id="part-3-adventures-in-alternative-social-media-2010--2016">Part 3: Adventures in Alternative Social Media (2010 – 2016)</h2>

<p>Seeking out critical reverse engineers of corporate social media set me
off on adventures in alternative social media in the years 2010-2016.</p>

<p>Most of the alternatives <a href="https://twentysix.fibreculturejournal.org/fcj-190-building-a-better-twitter-a-study-of-the-twitter-alternatives-gnu-social-quitter-rstat-us-and-twister/">I studied</a> were Twitter alternatives, such as GNU social and Twister.</p>

<p><a href="https://gnusocial.network/">GNU social</a> is a microblogging system that is free to download, install,
and run. It was was developed by Free Software activists who want to eliminate
proprietary software. It is federated (more on this in a bit).</p>

<p><a href="http://twister.net.co/">Twister</a> was a fascinating case – made by Miguel Freitas, a Brazilian
software engineer who wanted to provide protesters with censorship-resistant microblogging. He developed a peer-to-peer version of Twitter using both blockchain and bittorrent-style technologies.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2955827">also studied</a> Facebook alternatives, such as <a href="https://diasporafoundation.org/">diaspora</a>. diaspora was inspired by a presentation from law professor Eben Moglen to a bunch of NYU students in 2010 – so keep this in mind as you
present your research – technologists may be listening!</p>

<p>And <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1461444814554900">my work even took me onto the dark web</a> – networks where both
readers and producers of websites are anonymized. I studied several dark web social networking systems, where people relied on pseudonyms to engage in social media activities. Many of these systems run on the anonymizing <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor network</a>, but I found examples on <a href="https://geti2p.net/en/">I2P</a> and <a href="https://www.hyphanet.org/index.html">Freenet</a>, as well. Indeed, this work led me to write <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262038263/weaving-the-dark-web/">a book about the dark web</a>.</p>

<p>So, how are these critical reverse engineering projects? Let’s go back to the four orientations. These projects are</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Pragmatic</em>: They very often emulate Twitter, since Twitter’s
functionality is decidedly recognizable as social media but is
relatively simple to implement.</li>
  <li><em>Genealogical:</em> Not only do they examine corporate social media and
work back towards the original requirements, they also tend to be
built in reaction to the constant changes made to corporate social
media</li>
  <li><em>Legal:</em> They rely on the rights of reverse engineering. Freitas in particular talked to me about clean-room
requirements engineering.</li>
  <li>*Normative: All of these projects make claims to being more ethical
than corporate social media for a variety of reasons.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="critiques-of-their-normative-stances">Critiques of their normative stances</h3>
<p>However, I began to notice some shortcomings in that last, normative aspect.</p>

<p>One major reason the activists develop these systems is to shun surveillance capitalism. That’s obviously hugely important.</p>

<p>But the overarching philosophy of many of these projects is a very particular version of “freedom” that results in less just outcomes.</p>

<p>As I mention above, GNU social was developed by the Free Software Foundation, which touts Free Software and the “Four Freedoms.” These relate in part to freedom of speech, particularly in the face of government restrictions. Along for ride are discourses about openness and cyberlibertarian governance.</p>

<p>This program is extremely individual-centric. Taken to its extreme, it is about the eradication of the network in favor of the completely
sovereign individual. The desire seems to be an unfettered subject capable of wielding technology to openly speaking to anyone, anywhere.</p>

<p>Or, as Andrew Ross says in <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40068391">a critique of free software</a>, “Voices proclaiming freedom in every direction, but justice in none.” (I’m taking him a bit out of context, but I think it’s fair.)</p>

<p>There are many consequences of this freedom myopia.</p>

<p>One consequence of this is that it raises the specter of what the philosopher Herbert Marcuse called <a href="https://www.marcuse.org/herbert/publications/1960s/1965-repressive-tolerance-fulltext.html">“repressive tolerance,”</a> where the speech of the marginalized is eradicated through being made equal to
the speech of the dominant.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/bluelm.jpg" alt="The Blue Lives Matter flag flying in front of a banner that says 'Black Lives Matter.'" />
    <figcaption>
        This is the most visually coherent example of repressive tolerance I can think of. By stating "Blue lives matter," the ideas of the Black Lives Matter movement become eradicated by being placed on equal footing to those who are already in power -- the police.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While Marcuse supplies good examples from the 1960s, I explain repressive tolerance to students using the example of the utterance
“Blue Lives Matter” – a means to eradicate the Black Lives Matter movement by placing those already in power on an equal footing to Black
victims of police violence.</p>

<p>We saw this play out in the US and elsewhere in the form of the Alt-Right – <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262549417/gaming-democracy/">Adrienne Massanari has done excellent work</a> linking Gamergate, Silicon Valley ideologies, and rising fascism in the USA. The desire of repressive tolerance is to eradicate the presence of women, gender minorities, or racialized minorities from technical, leisure, and political spaces by maintaining the status quo.</p>

<p>We can also see repressive tolerance at work in the validation of the internet Edgelord – a phenomenon <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262529877/this-is-why-we-cant-have-nice-things/">best explored by Whitney Phillips</a>.</p>

<p>We saw the Gamergate and alt-right movements gain a great deal of traction on Twitter, but the fact is that they have also had a dominant presence on
alternative social media, as well, particularly those that have a sociotechnical imaginary of freedom and openness.</p>

<p>The brute fact is, it became increasingly difficult for me to find daylight between many of the alternative projects and Twitter during Gamergate.
“Alternative” began to seem, in many ways, to not be very alternative.</p>

<p>That brings me to the present.</p>

<h2 id="part-4-new-critical-reverse-engineers-on-the-fediverse-2017--present">Part 4: New Critical Reverse Engineers on the Fediverse (2017 – Present)</h2>

<p>The object spoke again, saying things I was unable to hear when I
started my career. I needed to seek new critical reverse engineers.</p>

<p>And that I needed to do the reading in Black philosophy, feminist
theory, and queer media studies: authors like <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-case-for-rage-9780197557341">Myisha Cherry</a>, <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1132416482">André
Brock</a>, <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1266907273">Catherine Knight Steele</a>, <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1374489678">Avery Dame-Griff</a>.</p>

<p>It will take a new wave of critical reverse engineers to reveal how
contemporary alternative social media can shed repressive tolerance.</p>

<h3 id="the-struggle-for-the-fediverse">The struggle for the fediverse</h3>

<p>This is, in large part, the focus of <a href="2024/02/11/Move-Slowy-Preview.html">my current book</a>, which examines
Mastodon and the Fediverse.</p>

<p>Because the fediverse includes a wide range of technologies, I focus on
<a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, a microblogging software package that can be installed and run
on modern web servers.</p>

<p>Mastodon provides a window not only into software engineering, but also
social and political interventions – particularly from marginalized
critical reverse engineers – in alternative social media.</p>

<h3 id="from-ostatus-to-activitypub">From OStatus to ActivityPub</h3>

<p>When many people speak about Mastodon, they often place it relation to
Twitter. This predates the Musk takeover of Twitter, but it has
certainly been amplified since then.</p>

<p>Mastodon appears to be an example of critical reverse engineering of
Twitter, and was hailed from its earliest days as such. <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/mastodon-is-like-twitter-without-nazis-so-why-are-we-not-using-it/">“Twitter without
the Nazis”</a> was a common descriptor.</p>

<p>But as I show in my book, Mastodon’s founder, Eugen Rochko, actually meant to critically reverse engineer another alternative, GNU social, in 2016. Mastodon was meant to be an alternative to an alternative. And this brought it into conflict with ideologies of freedom and openness – the ideologies of repressive tolerance.</p>

<p>Mastodon servers were initially able to communicate with GNU social over
a protocol called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OStatus">OStatus</a>. OStatus was a very Web 2.0 technology – it was about openness, the idea
that all of us should participate openly in discussion.</p>

<p>One goal among Mastodon’s developers was to provide safety tools to protect
marginalized folks, particularly queer and trans folks, allowing for users to
address their posts to particular, limited audiences and have more
control over who could reply.</p>

<p>These were features not available in GNU social (or, for that matter,
Twitter).</p>

<p>However, this grated against the everything-must-be-open-and-free ethos
of GNU social.</p>

<p>I won’t go into too much detail here, but one major issue was privacy
violations on the part of GNU social users, who would publicly expose
private posts from queer and trans Mastodon users in the name of
“openness” and “freedom.”</p>

<p>Fortunately, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub protocol</a> was being developed in 2016-2017,
and it had more robust privacy capacities. Four of the five authors self-identify
as queer, which might explain the new protocol’s affordances, including the
use of post addressing as a means to protect people.</p>

<p>Mastodon adopted ActivityPub, denying the repressive forms of openness
of OStatus in favor of safety for marginalized people.</p>

<h3 id="codes-of-conduct">Codes of Conduct</h3>

<p>Another anti-repressive tolerance move: the inclusion of codes of
conduct, as advocated for by activists such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coraline_Ada_Ehmke">Coraline Ada Ehmke</a>. Codes
of conduct are important in Mastodon’s history.</p>

<p>Ehmke’s work reflects feminist/trans activism in tech – the struggle
against meritocracy. This struggle emerged from projects like the <a href="https://geekfeminism.fandom.com/wiki/Geek_Feminism_Wiki">Geek Feminism wiki</a>, which
documented misogyny and transphobia at tech conventions.</p>

<p>These practices were cited as the reason why technology – particularly
FOSS technology – has had <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/06/diversity-open-source-even-worse-tech-overall/">a significant lack of contributions from
women and racialized minorities</a>.</p>

<p>Ehmke and her allies laid the feet of such behavior at the ideology of meritocracy in
tech, where, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar">Eric Raymond argued</a>, the only thing that matters is
great code. Implicitly, being a sexual abuser or racist is ok so long as
you can code.</p>

<p>Other scholars and activists have pointed to <a href="https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/4291">“pushyocracy,”</a> where it’s
not about great code but about who can shout the loudest, as a reason
why marginalized people avoided getting involved in the tech indstury.
(Linus Torvalds has been a key example of this, though he has since
sought forgiveness.)</p>

<p>Instead of meritocracy at tech conventions, Ehmke and her allies have
argued for Codes of Conduct, which have been largely adopted by both
tech conventions and free and open source projects.</p>

    <figcaption>
        While the Mastodon server covenant seems rather simple, the idea that a federated network of servers may all agree to things like "active moderation" is a cultural achievement. This is quite different from previous alternative social media.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As I show in the book, these Codes have <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/covenant">also been adopted by many
Mastodon servers</a>. I argue these act as fundamental diplomatic documents
in noncentralized social media: codes of conduct help structure
relations on the network. The active association among instances who
share ethical values indicates an ethical consensus is emerging across
the network including values of anti-racism and anti-transphobia.</p>

<h3 id="fediblock-and-blocklists">#Fediblock and Blocklists</h3>

<p>While much of the code of conduct discussion is about shared ethical
values, what about times when fediverse instances violate these
agreements? Another anti-repressive tolerance move can be found among those who
advocate severing connections.</p>

<p>Here I turn to another critical reverse engineer, Ro, founder of an
early Mastodon instance called “Playvicious.social.”</p>

<p>Playvicious was likely the first Black-run instance on Mastodon. But Ro shut it down in 2020, citing racist harassment of the moderators.
You can <a href="https://roiskinda.cool/2023/12/recuerda-pv-chapter-7-the-dark-and-ugly.html">read about it on his blog</a> – but I warn you, it’s heavy.</p>

<p>The Playvicious episode – and many others – reflected what Jonathan Flowers would later call []”the whiteness of
Mastodon,”](https://www.techpolicy.press/the-whiteness-of-mastodon/) the deeply embedded practices of whiteness that not only
include overt racism, but the subtle forms philosopher Myisha Cherry
calls “white skepticism” and “white empathy.”</p>

<p>But, to quote Flowers, Black critical reverse engineers continue to
contribute in spite of whiteness. In Ro’s case, he returned to the
network with a new project, a shared blocklist called <a href="https://thebad.space/">The Bad Space</a>.</p>

<p>Blocklists are now <a href="https://about.iftas.org/activities/moderation-as-a-service/fedicheck/">an emergent governance and moderation tool on the
fediverse</a>, enabling independent instances to import lists of known bad
actors and prevent them from interacting with instance members. Ro’s Bad Space isn’t the only project, though it is one that seems to attract the most criticism – recapitulating the Playvicious episode in a new form.</p>

<p>There’s another critical reverse engineer to cite here. Ro took inspiration for his blocklist from former Playvicious moderator
<a href="https://www.artistmarciax.com/">Marcia X</a>. Like many Black feminists, Marcia has contributed to the network,
co-creating a hashtag, #fediblock, for public discussions over how to
block racist instances and accounts on the network.</p>

<p>I’ve put their work into practice. The work of Black critical reverse
engineers has aided me directly – I now help run <a href="https://aoir.social">AoIR.social</a>, the Mastodon
instance for the Association of Internet Researchers, and we rely on
blocklists and #fediblock to prevent racists and transphobes from
interacting with our members.</p>

<h3 id="towards-the-covenantal-fediverse">Towards the Covenantal Fediverse</h3>

<p>Taken as a whole, these new critical reverse engineers have helped bring
about a new form of alternative social media.</p>

<p>It is a form a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2022.2147400">colleague and I have called</a> “the covenantal fediverse,” a
non-centralized, large network of small communities that associate
through shared ethical values.</p>

<p>Here is a new normative critical reverse engineering of corporate social
media. Returning to the four orientations of critical reverse engineering, let’s turn back to the normative orientation.</p>

<p>The normative aspect of Mastodon and the covenantal fediverse relates to previous alternative social media. In some ways, the fediverse continues older normative practices. It inherits the anti-surveillance capitalism aspects of previous alternatives, of course. Most of the fediverse operates on a non-capitalist, mutual aid economy. Much of it avoids behavioral advertising.</p>

<p>However, the older cyberlibertarianism is replaced – often in a messy and uneven way – with freedom of association. By accident or design, the Instance is a powerful unit. I would suggest that our understanding of the fediverse <a href="/2024/03/14/Instances-and-Individuals.html">needs to account more heavily for instances-as-communities</a> instead of the individual user (as has been privileged in cyberlibertarian thinking).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-will-this-survive">Conclusion: Will this survive?</h2>
<p>Now I have traced a new form of critical reverse engineering, one
operating on both corporate social media and previous alternative social
media. I believe it is best existing path away from corporate social
media.</p>

<p>And yet, while millions of people took up Mastodon after Musk’s purchase
of Twitter, billions remain on corporate social media.</p>

<p>To return to where I started, even critical media organizations that
speak of non-corporate media continue to use corporate social media!</p>

<p>We might ask “can this platform survive?” as <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4598303">several colleagues from
American University and I do</a> in a forthcoming paper in the <em>International
Journal of Communication</em>.</p>

<p>And my answer is: I don’t know. Many alternative projects have failed.</p>

<p>But let’s again listen to the object. Alternative social media speaks of hope, even
in the face of failure (however we define that idea!). To use a term
from speculative fiction, alternative social media speaks of <em>porvir
otimista.</em></p>

<p>Don’t despair in the face of the sociotechnical systems you confront.
Instead, critically reverse engineer them.</p>]]></content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="Goal 2" /><category term="critical reverse engineering" /><category term="presentations" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently gave a presentation to the Cultural Studies PhD program at George Mason University. That’s the program where I earned my PhD, so it was an honor to come back and talk to my professors as well as some of the new students currently in the program. I took the presentation as an opportunity to reflect on my academic career from my time at Mason (2005-2010) to my latest book project. I’ve modified it for this blog. Take a look at the abstract and, if piques your interest, feel free to read it! (It’s a bit long.) Abstract In my time as a PhD student in GMU’s Cultural Studies program, I learned that I must let my object of study tell me what methods to use to analyze it. I also learned not to merely interpret the object, but seek to change it. Since I chose to study what was then called “Web 2.0” and what I now call “corporate social media,” I needed to bring Marxian political economy, science and technology studies, and software studies to bear on the object. And I began to examine the practices of activists who sought to make something better than corporate social media: alternative social media. Over a decade ago I began my adventures in alternative social media, chasing it through hacker collectives, cyberlibertarian organizations, and even onto the dark web. Through digital ethnography, close examinations of code, and hands-on experience running alternative social media, I developed an approach I call “critical reverse engineering.” Here I present critical reverse engineering as a methodology for activist engagement with digital technologies. To illustrate this approach, I will draw on insights from my forthcoming book, Move Slowly and Build Bridges: Mastodon, the Fediverse, and the Struggle for Ethical Social Media (Oxford, 2025).]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Goodbye, Firefox?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2024/09/18/goodbyeFirefox.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Goodbye, Firefox?" /><published>2024-09-18T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-09-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2024/09/18/goodbyeFirefox</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2024/09/18/goodbyeFirefox.html"><![CDATA[<p>I think I’m going to stop using Firefox altogether.

  <figcaption>Firefox is no longer my default browser, and it has a sad face. I'm sad about it, too.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So, one day I opened a new tab in Firefox and there it was: a weather report. A tiny little temp reading for my area. I didn’t think about it much, but someone on the fediverse noted that this little weather app is sponsored by AccuWeather, a company <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/environment/project-2025-paywall-weather/">long criticized for its attempt to privatize public weather information</a>. Hovering over the little temp reading revealed this to be true – it said, “Sponsored by AccuWeather.”</p>

<p>And that broke me.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>To be fair, it’s not the only thing. <a href="https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/discussions/firefox-changing-my-settings-on-update/m-p/14155">Like others</a>, I’ve started to see privacy settings being reset every time I update Firefox. I set the default search to be Startpage instead of Google – an update wiped that and set it to Google, again. I set my homepage to not have Pocket or sponsored links – an update wiped that.</p>

<p>Pretty soon each new tab suggested I go to Facebook. <em>Fucking Facebook</em>.</p>

<p>Mozilla bashing has become kind of a common sport, so much so that one of my favorite podcasts, <em>Late Night Linux</em>, has gotten bored of doing it. But once I saw the little AccuWeather thingy, I started watching for critical comments on Mozilla. And I saw what many others have already pointed out:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/networking/the-fall-of-firefox-mozillas-once-popular-web-browser-slides-into-irrelevance/">Firefox browser share plummeting in inverse proportion to CEO pay</a></li>

  <li><a href="https://www.mozilla.ai/_">AI bullshit</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/mozilla-social-faq">and an end to the laudable experiment with the fediverse</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>My attitude towards these critical takes has long been to ignore them. “Whatever Mozilla wants to do is fine as long as they make a good browser,” I said to myself. But lately it seems like they’re actively trying to kill off Firefox rather than continuing to make a great browser.</p>

<p>The thing is, with all the papercuts, Firefox is still quite good. But this is FOSS. Forks are a thing. I’m now testing out <a href="https://librewolf.net/">LibreWolf</a>, a privacy-conscious fork of Firefox, and so far, so good.</p>

<p>What’s sad about this, though, is that I’ve been using Firefox for nearly two decades – almost as long as Firefox has been around. It was my <a href="/2020/12/15/FOSS-Journey.html">introduction point into the world of FOSS</a>. First it, then OpenOffice, then Ubuntu, and now I run as much FOSS as I can.</p>

<p>Maybe I will come back to Firefox, but if not, I’m still grateful for its role in my career.</p>]]></content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="FALD" /><category term="Goal 1" /><category term="Firefox" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think I’m going to stop using Firefox altogether.

I’ll also discuss <a href="https://latenightlinux.com/late-night-linux-episode-297/">a recent podcast episode</a> that talks about the ethics of using and promoting FOSS.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="aoirsocial-data-were-included-in-an-academic-study--and-thats-ok">AoIR.social data were included in an academic study – and that’s OK</h2>
<p>I’m one of the admins of <a href="https://aoir.social">AoIR.social</a>, a Mastodon instance for members of the Association of Internet Researchers. In the AoIR.social Code of Conduct, we include the following bit about research:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Researchers who wish to study AoIR.social or our users by collecting data using the API or through any other means that does not involve an “opt-in” from individual users are required to submit their protocol, analysis plan and all relevant ethics approval documentation from their institutional review board or departmental internal review documentation by email to the AoIR Fediverse admin account. You may also be required to submit code you plan to execute so that it can be tested to ensure it does not degrade the quality of service to other users.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I just found a study that most likely included data culled from AoIR.social via the Mastodon API, and… I’m not mad! I don’t think they violated our Code. In fact, I think the authors did the fediverse a huge service.</p>

<p>The study in question is <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11616-024-00855-6">“‘Don’t research us’ – How Mastodon instance rules connect to research ethics,”</a> by Marco Wähner et al. It appeared in <em>Publizistik</em> a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>The authors are asking whether and how Mastodon instances signal their preferences for the collection and use of data for research purposes, as well as what ethical issues arise when researchers gather data from Mastodon’s API.</p>

<p>Through the use of the Mastodon API, they pulled in codes of conduct from over 4000 active English-language Mastodon instances. They then quantitatively and qualitatively examine those codes. While they found that many COCs emphasize rules of behavior on the instance (e.g., no racism, no transphobia), only 31 English-language instances actually address research ethics and discuss data usage.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, AoIR.social is in their dataset, since we address the topic explicitly. So, why am I not upset with Wähner et al’s own paper, then?</p>

<p>It’s because this research team did not study <em>individuals</em>, but rather focused on <em>instances</em>. This is exactly <a href="https://www.cell.com/patterns/fulltext/S2666-3899(23)00323-9">the point I’ve made elsewhere</a> with fellow fediverse researcher Roel Roscam Abbing. I also <a href="/2024/03/14/Instances-and-Individuals.html">posted a bit more</a> about the individual/instance distinction on this blog. We need these studies and data – maps of the fediverse, population data, and trends in codes of conduct language are valuable insights.</p>

<p>And not only will the fediverse benefit from Wähner et al’s work, I agree with their claim that pulling instance codes of conduct does no harm to fediverse members. I do not see it as a violation when people do instance-level studies of the fediverse without getting the consent of fediverse admins.</p>

<p>In light of the fact that only a small number of instances post explicit rules about research data use, the authors offer some recommendations to researchers. I’ll get to them, but first, let’s talk about implications for instance admins like me.</p>

<p>One implication of their study is that Mastodon and fediverse instances ought to include rules about research in their codes of conduct. This may be a wise thing for instance admins and community members to consider. However, I think we should not merely make this recommendation. It puts too much burden on instance admins and communities. If fediverse instances must write rules for every unethical case they might possibly encounter, their codes of conduct will shift from human-readable, community documents to legalese-drenched Terms of Service agreements found more often in corporate social media.</p>

<p>No, the answer here is that researchers, not instances, need more ethical training and thinking. One approach might be to consider codes of conduct in the aggregate and proceed from the assumption that a prohibition on a handful of instances indicates a much broader – if unstated – prohibition across the fediverse itself. Researchers might protest at this, arguing this would stifle their work, but I would argue that ethical approaches to fediverse research should meet an extremely high bar.</p>

<p>In fact, Wähner et al make this same point:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The characteristics of the user community may lead to the expectation that users may hold a (more) critical stance towards user data collection on Mastodon. Of course, as stated before, the total number of 31 instance rules explicitly addressing data use for research purposes is quite low. Providing a detailed explanation for why there are not more instance rules reflecting on research data collection is beyond the scope of this paper. However, based on research on the general lack of awareness for the fact that researchers are using data collected from social media platforms (Breuer et al. 2023; Quinton and Reynolds 2017), we assume that this is also true for a substantial share (if not the majority) of Mastodon users (Wähner et al., 2024, p. 16).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For those who wish to examine individual-level data, Wähner et al go on to offer several suggestions for researchers of the fediverse, including paying attention to instance rules. They note that if an instance explicitly prohibits the use of member data, researchers ought to expunge it – even in cases where the data will be anonymized. They also recommend reaching out to – and collaborating with! – instance admins in research design. Admins can be useful guides in getting informed consent among fediverse members.</p>

<p>I agree, and thus I recommend this study to future fediverse researchers. I’ll definitely put this study in <a href="/bib.html">the Bibliography</a>.</p>

<h2 id="late-night-linux-tackles-the-ethics-of-advocating-foss">Late Night Linux tackles the ethics of advocating FOSS</h2>
<p>Speaking of ethics, the crew at the Late Night Linux podcast just raised a bunch of ethical issues in FOSS, ones that I tackle in my <a href="/2024/02/11/Move-Slowy-Preview.html">forthcoming book about Mastodon and the fediverse</a>. In <a href="https://latenightlinux.com/late-night-linux-episode-297/">their latest episode</a>, the hosts talk about what to do when we deal with unethical Internet corporations. Cloudflare is one they highlight. X is another. Is it unethical to use their products? Or to give your custom to companies that do?</p>

<p>Both of these examples are quite germane to my book. In it, I definitely talk about how the actions of X have prompted a shift from that platform to the fediverse (among other alternatives). I also talk about a somewhat shameful secret of the noncentralized fediverse: that it often relies on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3355369.3355572">centralized cloud hosting services (such as Amazon) and technologies (such as Cloudflare) to function</a>.</p>

<p>So, should we despair if we cannot escape unethical corporations? The LNL crew largely said, no. You try your best, and you do better over time.</p>

<p>But the real answer came in their next segment, which was about advocating that Windows Subsystem for Linux users make the switch to mainline Linux. The LNL crew <a href="https://mastodon.cloud/@LateNightLinux/113005956969609375">posted this question to Mastodon</a>, and the dominant answer was: no. Let people solve problems in the way that works. The best you can do is show them the benefits of the better stuff you use.</p>

<p>I think the same is true of the fediverse. We could berate people for using corporate social media. I’ve found over many years, however, that that doesn’t work. Instead, show people what you use and talk about why it’s better. If they switch, great! If not, that’s ok. The fediverse isn’t about infinite or rapid growth. It’s about growing slowly and purposely.</p>]]></content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="ASM update" /><category term="research ethics" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this ASM update, I’ll write at length about a new research study on Mastodon that gets the ethics of research right – even though they pulled data from my home Mastodon instance.

While I enjoyed my vacation, I was naturally eager to get home to try it out!</p>

<p>In my initial review, I found an improved interface design with small changes that improve (instead of interrupt) my workflow, as well as some nice improvements to the PDF Reader (which is now really an Attachment Reader).</p>

<p>I may do a more substantial review as I use Zotero 7 to get stuff done, but my first glance leaves me quite happy with this new version.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="easy-to-upgrade-and-easy-on-the-eyes">Easy to upgrade, and easy on the eyes</h2>
<p>Upgrading was easy in Linux – I just used Zotero’s “check for updates” option and upgraded from Zotero 6 to 7. The only thing that “broke” was the application icon, but I just edited my menu to point to the new icon.</p>

<p>On first run, it gave me an option between “Comfortable” and “Compact” layouts. I could toggle between the two to quickly see the differences. I choose Compact, which tightens up the gaps between entries and text. The overall look is clean while still very familiar. (I don’t know about you, but I really can’t stand major interface upgrades, which is a big reason I use Linux – I prefer to keep things stable for years).</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/resm_zoteroPreview.png" alt="A preview of my first book in the Zotero Item Preview pane" />
  <figcaption>My first book as shown in Zotero's new Item Preview pane</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The new Item Preview is particularly attractive. One upshot is that it shows “Related” items in a more visible manner than in past Zotero iterations. I think this could be quite useful. In my experience, relating items really didn’t provide much insight for me. I did it, anyway, on the theory that maybe in the future the data would be useful. Perhaps the time is now?</p>

<p>And a change that is very welcome is dark mode! I had installed a third-party dark mode theme in Zotero 6, so this didn’t jump out at me. That is, until I saw <strong>dark mode in PDFs</strong>! Amazing! I tried to hack this on my own (and largely failed), but it’s working natively now.</p>

<h2 id="cool-new-features">Cool new features</h2>
<p>Speaking of PDF annotation, it now includes underlining text in various colors in addition to highlighting. And, either can be converted to the other with just a click. This is a feature I didn’t even know I wanted, but now I think I like it! I can see myself doing underlining instead of highlighting from here on out.</p>

<p>And the PDF reader does a bunch more than load PDFs! It also can handle EPUBs, and – importantly for me – it shows Web snapshots! It’s more of an Attachment Reader now. And those snapshots can be marked up in a similar fashion as PDFs. However, I did see some bugs – in my first test of the snapshot annotation feature, it didn’t show underlines, and it barely showed highlights. I can imagine it’s a tricky matter to code an annotation for heterogeneous HTML and CSS.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/snapshot_Highlighting.png" alt="An example of editing a web snapshot in Zotero" />
  <figcaption>Editing my snapshot of the Post-Meritocratic Manifesto in Zotero. One problem here is highlights and underlines don't show up well.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In spite of this problem, it’s going to be a useful feature.</p>

<p>Other interface improvements include tab selection with a drop-down. This is a really cool idea, letting me select tabs in a drop-down menu. This might be good for those who use a lot of tabs. I can also search across tabs. So far, it appears to be limited to item titles.</p>

<p>As far as performance goes, Zotero opens at least as fast as before, and it uses 2GB of RAM. It’s clear version 7 is not a downgrade in terms of speed. In fact, PDFs seem to load slightly faster into the reader. I don’t really do benchmarking, but in my experience, their claim that there are performance improvements holds up.</p>

<p>Turning to in-text citation system, I noticed no major changes here, but one subtle one: a way to export the document from one word processor (e.g., LibreOffice) to another (e.g., Word). I don’t know if this will solve the problem of cross-word processor collaboration or not yet.</p>

<h2 id="features-i-dont-know-if-i-like--yet">Features I don’t know if I like – yet</h2>

<p>Zotero has redesigned the item pane to include icons, rather than text, as the main navigational tool. This saves space, but it makes things a bit less accessible.</p>

<p>They also changed the icons in the center column after many years of using the same icons. I might get used to picking out the differences between various item types at a glance, but I’m not sure I will get used to it. Fortunately, I can add “Item Type” as a column if need be.</p>

<h2 id="features-i-still-want-to-see">Features I still want to see</h2>

<p>There are still features I want to see – stuff I’ve been wanting for years.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/smartFolders.png" alt="A list of smart folders in Zotero" />
  <figcaption>Here's a portion of my smart folders, specifically tied to my Mastodon/fediverse book project. Note my pre-pending each with a "1" -- that's my way to keep them organized.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>First, I believe it would be great to have the ability to nest smart searches within traditional folders. Right now, the two folder types are traditional, where you create a folder and drag stuff into it, or smart, which dynamically updates based on search criteria. I use the latter almost exclusively, but this results is a long list of smart searches. As you can see from a screenshot, I use a simple fix – I prepend a number to the smart search folder titles to keep similar searches grouped together. I would much prefer to be able to make save these searches together in a top-level folder.</p>

<p>I also remain underwhelmed by the tag management system. It remains a small corner section in the layout. I recall Endnote’s system, which was a separate window with all tags listed alphabetically, making it much easier to scroll through them, delete unwanted tags, and merge tags.</p>

<h2 id="hitting-a-nerve">Hitting a Nerve</h2>
<p>A colleague of mine shared <a href="https://www.thebookseller.com/news/academic-authors-shocked-after-taylor--francis-sells-access-to-their-research-to-microsoft-ai">an article from <em>The Bookseller</em></a> that reports that Taylor and Francis – which is a major publisher of academic articles and books – is selling access to its catalog to Microsoft to train AI. [Note that <em>The Bookseller</em> provides free access to one article per month.]</p>

<p>I got a bit upset and <a href="https://aoir.social/deck/@rwg/112819578544558425">posted this</a> to the fediverse:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After 15+ years of hustling to publish #academic journal articles and books, a significant proportion of my work is now being sold off to #Microsoft to train #LLMs. I never consented to this, and of course when I started my career, I never predicted this.
That whoosh you’re hearing is me rushing to sign on to whatever class action lawsuit is in the offing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This hit a bit of a nerve on the fediverse, with quite a few folks boosting the post. That tells me I’m not alone in being angry about this.</p>

<p>It turns out that the Microsoft deal isn’t the only one. Taylor and Francis has <a href="https://www.thebookseller.com/news/taylor-francis-set-to-make-58m-from-ai-in-2024-as-it-reveals-second-partnership">announced another</a>. According to <em>The Bookseller</em>, “the business said it plans to reinvest a third of its AI-related profit into ‘accelerated technology, open research and AI product development… based on our unique content.’”</p>

<p>There’s that word. Content. For years I’ve resisted the appelation “content creator.” I find it to be insulting, frankly. I don’t spend my days filling containers. People who operate machines that deposit food into cans are content creators. (No insult meant to people who work in factories!)</p>

<p>But now my “unique content” is going to feed shitty AI bots that no doubt will help write bad journal articles or provide “expertise” via some chat or search applications.</p>

<p>This isn’t what I signed up for. This isn’t what being an open academic who publishes work for others to build on meant to me when I started.</p>

<p>I don’t know if there is any legal recourse. I’ll leave that to lawyers – and if there is a class action suit, sign me up!</p>

<p>But I do know that we academics really ought to withhold our work from massively profitable corporations who view us as content creators. That means no reviewing for T&amp;F, no submissions to T&amp;F journals, and no publishing books with Routledge.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that means we’ll have to likely boycott SAGE and Elsevier, as well.</p>

<h2 id="ietf-presentation">IETF Presentation</h2>

<p>In happier news, I presented research to the IETF. I’ve never been to an IETF meeting and I think by and large it went well.</p>

<p>I presented a version of what will be the second chapter of my book, which focuses on the intertwined histories of ActivityPub and Mastodon. The presentation was part of a panel of folks studying standardization processes. I was especially impressed by the work of Diane Liao and Michelle Parkouda (as presented by Liao) on ways in which standards bodies could consider differential impacts of standards based on gender.</p>

The list (as of this writng) has over 660 entries. Since I am finalizing a chapter on Threads for my <a href="/2024/02/11/Move-Slowy-Preview.html">forthcoming book</a>, I will definitely have to consider this list in detail. For now, I wanted to offer a few comments on this development, since it’s a decidedly important moment in the ActivityPub-based fediverse.</p>

<!-- more -->
<h2 id="meta-is-being-transparent-sorta">Meta is being transparent… sorta</h2>
<p>I want to offer the most charitable take I can first: this public blocklist is one of the biggest moments of tranparency that Meta has ever engaged in. Maybe some of my academic colleagues who closely monitor Meta could correct me, but this strikes me as Meta offering quite a bit more insight into content moderation practices than they have in the past.</p>

<p>I think credit is due to the fediverse as a whole on this one, though. If Meta truly wishes to integrate with the fediverse, they have to follow the protocols, and I don’t just mean ActivityPub – they have to follow the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2022.2147400">social protocols of transparent, open moderation</a>. While typically this is in the form of simple, clear codes of conduct and open communication from moderators, posting a blocklist publicly a good step in the direction of transparency.</p>

<h2 id="this-may-be-the-first-time-millions-see-blocking-in-action">This may be the first time millions see blocking in action</h2>
<p>When I first started out on the ActivityPub-based fediverse back in early 2017, most Mastodon instances published their blocklists. Admins can still do this – indeed, Mastodon.social, the largest server, <a href="https://mastodon.social/about">does (scroll down and click on “moderated servers”)</a>.</p>

<p>However, over the past few years, many smaller servers stopped sharing this information publicly. Why? Well, it’s obviously a vector for harassment. For example, if as an admin I publicly say I block bad.instance, their friends could harass me with constant requests about why I did so, arguing that I need to change my mind. I have other stuff to do. Many admins just keep their blocklists to themselves.</p>

<p>So Threads is revealing something many of the millions of new fediverse members have not often seen: the fact that a healthy server <em>must</em> block many others in order to moderate effectively. It’s a fact of fediverse life.</p>

<p>This is a pretty radical change for Meta, to be honest: they now have to declare their relationship to the rest of the web, rather than just pretend that the web must flow through Meta properties.</p>

<h2 id="blocking-nazis-and-nudity">Blocking Nazis and nudity</h2>
<p>Of course, transparency allows for scrutiny. We can take a look at the 660+ blocks and see what sort of values Meta adheres to.</p>

<p>First of all, there are a lot of instances on their list that I completely agree need to be blocked, including overtly white supremacist instances. I won’t specify these, but if you look at the list, you’ll see what I mean just from the URLs. There are also instances geared towards sharing sexualized cartoon images of children (a practice tolerated in Japan, but not by the rest of the fediverse). You can likely guess from those URLs, too.</p>

<p>However, multiple fediverse members have pointed out that Threads is blocking many queer and trans instances. While we’d have to dig in to figure out why, the most likely answer is that Meta has policies against nudity. Indeed, Meta’s own Oversight Board found that <a href="https://gizmodo.com/instagram-meta-age-verification-system-ai-1849753822">Meta is too aggressive in blocking nudity among LBTQ* users</a>, including posts discussing top surgery.</p>

<p>In my interview with Mastodon founder Eugen Rochko, he saw such bans on consenting adult nudity as a very US-centric approach to global content moderation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[On the fediverse], there are thousands of other providers across the entire world, each giving a little bit of social space to the world, that is not controlled entirely from the US. And we know that US politics is not very stable – there’s a lot of turbulence. Trump was in charge, and that was not great for progressive laws.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some laws were passed, about 5 years ago, that affected a lot of sex workers – the SESTA and FOSTA bills – that basically erased sex work from social media because [so much] social media is based in the US. I think that’s not fair, because in Germany sex work is legal. Sex work <em>is</em> work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Threads blocklist appears to be an extension of this logic: yet another attempt to moderate the globe from California.</p>

<p>Of course, if we think of Threads as another node on the fediverse, well… they can block whomever they wish for whatever reason. But the fact is, Meta is so large that if the rest of the fediverse tries to connect to it, we will defacto have US-based regulations on a highly localized, global network.</p>

<p>Indeed, Rochko’s own Mastodon.social should probably be blocked by Threads, since it allows for pornography. In fact, several folks on the fediverse saw that Mastodon.social was blocked for 30 minutes, though it didn’t seem to affect the connection.</p>

<p>Was that a mistake? Or a warning shot?</p>

<h2 id="you-blocked-what-now">You blocked what now?</h2>
<p>Threads blocking white supremacists and loli comics strikes me as a fine choice. I don’t agree at all with their blocking LGBTQ instances, but if they insist on blocking nudity, I suppose it makes some sense – if only in a bland, shopping mall sort of way.</p>

<p>But some of their blocking choices make no sense to me.</p>

<p>For example, Threads blocks Scholar.social. An instance dedicated to acadmics, Scholar.social is one of the oldest Mastodon instances, and it has been a model of content moderation, safety for marginalized folks, and thoughtful federation practices. I know it very well because it was my home instance for several years. And when I shifted to being an admin of AoIR.social, we asked for permission to copy Scholar’s code of conduct.</p>

<p>The only reason Threads offers for the block is Scholar “Violated our Community Guidelines or Terms of Use.” I have no idea what this could mean. But the good news is, I know for a fact that Scholar would never federate with anything Meta, anyway, so I imagine their being blocked by Meta is a badge of honor!</p>

<p>Other confusing blocking choices that jump out to me are Kolektiva.social and Tabletop.social, two instances I also find to be well-moderated. Again, the justification is violated community guidelines. And, again, I don’t think these servers care, since they are signatories to the <a href="https://fedipact.online/">Anti-Threads Fedipact</a>.</p>

<p>For the rest of us – those of us who haven’t been blocked by Meta – take these arbitrary choices as a warning: if you attempt to federate with Threads, perhaps have a plan for when Threads blocks you and your members.</p>

<h2 id="cross-referencing-ahoy">Cross referencing ahoy!</h2>
<p>Confusing decisions aside, it would be fascinating to cross-reference Threads’s blocklist with shared blocklists, like the Bad Space, Oliphaunt’s list, Sierdy’s, and Garden Fence. I myself drew on these lists when we started AoIR.social. As I mentioned above, this is at least a bit of transparency from a Meta property – we can learn a great deal about what they’re thinking. But we can also learn what the broader fediverse values by comparing Meta’s blocklist to those of other servers as well as shared lists.</p>

<p>As is clear from looking at the list, Meta continues to have a particular vision for global moderation. If you’re looking to emulate Meta-style blocking, you can copy their list. If you reject Meta values, take a long hard look at their list and ask yourself if you should block the same servers.</p>

<p>If this were just any fediverse server, I don’t think this blocklist would draw too much attention. But if it is an indication that this incredibly large, powerful social media corporation intends to reshape the fediverse in its image, and if they insist on blocking several well-moderated servers, it is a disturbing list – not because of the choices they made that are right, but because of the arbitrary choices they make that simply get it wrong.</p>]]></content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="Threads" /><category term="Goal 2" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta’s Threads, which is slowly enabling ActivityPub capabilities, has just posted a list of servers it is blocking.

<blockquote>
  <p>We are trying to connect up to the Fediverse, to allow interaction with other ActivityPub servers.  This definitely seems to me to be within the spirit of what ActivityPub enables, but of course, I don’t want to have Maven connect to anybody who doesn’t want it.</p>

<p>[Note that I normally do not quote fediverse posts without permission, but in this case, I am making an exception, for reasons that I think will be obvious.]</p>

<p>I replied in the thread, arguing that, no, they are not really abiding by the spirit of ActivityPub:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This isn’t how this works. No one starts a fediverse (AP) server by ingesting a bunch of posts from others without their consent. They start servers and start federating with the rest of the network.
Please stop ingesting posts from AoIR.social (I’m the admin, btw).</p>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The custom is to start a server with a code of conduct, including clear moderation rules, so that the rest of us can make informed choices about federating.

It’s a poor way to start an ActivityPub implementation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be fair to Secretran and Maven, they have since stopped scraping my posts and, I presume, those of others who have asked them to stop. Still, I eagerly await Maven’s full ActivityPub implementation so that we can block them effectively.</p>

<p>This incident got me to thinking about norms and customs on the fediverse and how important they are.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="states-of-exception-versus-the-big-empty">States of Exception versus The Big Empty</h2>
<p>While the Maven incident was happening, the Mastodon instance I’m helping to run, AoIR.social, is gearing up for a wave of new members. The reason is that registration for the <a href="https://aoir.org/aoir2024/">2024 Association of Internet Researchers conference</a> is now open. Every paid AoIR member has access to our Mastodon server, and with every conference we get new folks who join the Association. So, we’re going to get new folks on the server. Our idea is that, since Twitter is now utterly garbage, our members need a new microblogging home to share their work.</p>

<p>There’s an important contrast to be drawn between the Maven incident and the new wave of AoIR.social members. As a start-up, Maven appears to have adopted a classic Silicon Valley logic of the “<a href="https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2799">state of exception</a>,” where one must quickly grow at all costs. One way to supercharge your growth is to simply steal content from other sources. It worked for YouTube back in the 2000s and for AI companies more recently. In the case of Maven, given its AI-based approach, it’s pretty clear the goal was to scrape a bunch of social content from an easy source (Mastodon.social) to train their models upon to produce their “interest-based” social media service.</p>

<p>In contrast, joining a Mastodon server for the first time is a bit of lonely experience. I can imagine that many new AoIR.social members may be looking at their big, empty feeds and wondering what’s next. Whom should I follow? How do I find my colleagues? Will anyone follow me? Even with things like trending topics and recommended accounts to follow, Mastodon and the fediverse is not going to do much to shape what a new user does. In the interviews I’ve conducted <a href="/2024/02/11/Move-Slowy-Preview.html">for my book</a>, I heard from many folks who said joining the fediverse was much colder than joining a corporate social media site.</p>

<p>So, perhaps the steal-and-grow approach is best? Perhaps Maven is justified to ingest a bunch of content to present to would-be new users? Doing so could jumpstart the hard process of making yet another social media site.</p>

<p>But I don’t think so.</p>

<h2 id="the-irony-of-maven">The Irony of Maven</h2>

<p>Let’s consider the supreme irony of Maven’s ingestion of posts without consent. As <a href="https://www.heymaven.com/about">they explain on their “About” page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s not right that every alternative to the popularity contest on one site is just a popularity contest on another.  We deserve a place to go where you can connect to people simply because you share interests, where you can speak without 100% confidence because you aren’t “performing” in front of a bunch of judges, where you can simply hold a conversation because you’re curious about the subject matter, where everyone isn’t there to build a brand and become an influencer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is, they’re suggesting that social media is mired in empty performances in order to gain clout, but thanks to their innovative AI, we can have social media without such clout-chasing. Instead of what’s <em>popular</em>, we’ll get what’s <em>good</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Part of the idea behind Maven is that there is an enormous flux of ideas and interests out there on the internet that we never get to see or interact with because everything we experience is always based on popularity.  That changes with Maven.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would mitigate</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the fact that only a tiny elite 0.1% of the population (with say 10K followers or more) can get any substantial amount of engagement while everyone else are just supporting cast members.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That all sounds great: it’s addressing a key concern people have about corporate social media, that it’s just a platform for a handful of famous influencers.</p>

<p>But here’s the irony: in order to get their service off the ground, they ingested millions of posts from the fediverse to make their service seem… <em>more popular than it actually is.</em> They’re using fediverse content to gain attention. Hell, they’ll probably get some media coverage out this, at least.</p>

<p>In contrast, the new member of AoIR.social, staring down a blank feed, might think that the fediverse isn’t for them. There’s nothing to jumpstart the process of building out a presence on the fedi.</p>

<p>But the new fedi member posts once, and gets a reply. Then again, and some followers. Over time, with a bit of work, they’re entering into conversations.</p>

<p>And for those who want to start a fediverse instance, that will <em>really</em> be empty. But if you work at it – making a code of conduct, inviting people to join, doing the work of moderating – then your server will integrate into the fediverse.</p>

<p>Those are the norms of the fediverse: do the work. Explore. Reach out. Moderate. Learn. Grow slowly.</p>

<p>And don’t steal the work of others.</p>

<p>By effectively stealing posts from the fediverse in order to look more popular than it is, Maven has utterly blown their chance to be the alternative they claim they want to be. And even if they have stopped scraping and do a proper ActivityPub implementation, they’re going to be #fediblocked pretty severely from here on out.</p>]]></content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="Maven" /><category term="Ethics" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ever-alert Liaizon Wakest has informed the rest of us on the ActivityPub-based fediverse of a new social media site, Maven, which has ingested millions of posts from fediverse accounts, including mine.

Microsoft has been doing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/24/24138949/microsoft-windows-11-start-menu-ads-recommendations-setting-disable">lots of other things</a>. Apparently these things have led to people <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/10-reasons-not-to-upgrade-to-windows-11">not wanting to use Windows 11, the latest Windows</a> – or even stop using Windows altogether.</p>

<p>It seems people are upset – so much so, they are talking about switching to Linux. For those of you who are academics (or in related fields), I can tell you: the switch is entirely feasible.</p>

<p>I’ve been using Linux since about 2008 or so to do my academic work. After writing <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/search?q=robert+w+gehl&amp;author=Gehl+Robert+W&amp;itemType=book&amp;itemSubType=book-printbook%2Cbook-digital%2Cbook-thsis">three books</a> with a <a href="2024/02/11/Move-Slowy-Preview.html">fourth on the way</a>, as well as nearly <a href="https://www.robertwgehl.org/publications.php?styleSheetSelection=mobile">30 peer-reviewed articles</a>, I’d say it’s clear the work can be done with Linux.</p>

<p>I should note I’m in the humanities, not computer science, so I’m using Linux mainly to write, research, and collaborate with other authors doing social science work. And it’s also important to note that I have worked at “Microsoft Campuses” for my whole career, meaning most of my colleagues use Windows and the IT folks support mostly Windows. In fact, when IT finds out I use Linux, they tend to say “We don’t officially support that” (and then they help as best they can). So I am definitely proof an academic can survive using Linux.</p>

<p>Here, I want to talk a bit about my experience using Linux and Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) as an academic for the past two decades and toss in some tips for those thinking of switching. I hope it’s helpful, and if you have questions, let me know!</p>

<p>(Also, before I begin: use whatever computer OS you like! I’m not judging! I just want to help academics who might want to switch.)

<h2 id="use-an-older-computer">Use an older computer</h2>
<p>One thing I’ve enjoyed over the years of using Linux is that it works great on older computers. These days, when I buy a new computer, I expect to get about 5-10 years of performance out of it. This keeps computers out of landfills, and it helps me with things like writing routines.</p>

<p>So, if you’re considering switching from Windows to Linux, get an old laptop (buy a used one, or grab one you have in a closet) and install Linux on that one. That way, you’re not stressed out about losing data. Even if you make a mistake in installing Linux, you’re not out of luck. You can start out small, doing some work tasks on the Linux machine with the safety net of the Windows machine as support. Over time, you can migrate data and accounts to the new machine until you’ve developed a new workflow.</p>

<p>Another approach that’s similar is “dual booting” – that is, using the same computer but with two operating systems (e.g., Windows and Linux). You pick which one you want to use when you start the computer. Many Linux distributions will guide you through installing Linux alongside Windows. You keep your old data this way, but you have a new operating system to experiment with.</p>

<p>Or, if you’ve got the funds, buy a computer with Linux pre-installed. There are companies that specialize in this, like <a href="https://system76.com/">System76</a> in the US. And big computer companies, such as Dell and Lenovo, offer Linux options. You can get anything from budget machines to really high-end computers with Linux pre-installed.</p>

<h2 id="pick-a-distribution-of-linux">Pick a distribution of Linux</h2>
<p>Probably the most confusing part of this is the fact that there isn’t just one Linux – there are many “distributions” (“distos” for short). The good news is most of them are great for people switching from Windows, because that’s a really common path people take.</p>

<p>If you buy a new computer from a company like Dell or System76, they will do the work of selecting a distribution for you. System76 uses one called <a href="https://pop.system76.com/">Pop OS</a>, and Dell offers <a href="https://ubuntu.com/desktop">Ubuntu</a>. Those are great choices!</p>

<p>And there are others. I myself am using <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a>, specifically one with a user interface called <a href="https://kde.org/">KDE</a>.</p>

<p>And you can switch later! If you use one distribution, and you want to try others, you can. It’s called “distro hopping” and I do it for fun.</p>

<p>But! I don’t want you to be overwhelmed. Basically, I’d suggest picking one (Ubuntu is always a safe choice) and using it as you learn. Don’t stress too much about this.</p>

<h2 id="find-a-buddy-tune-out-the-zealots">Find a buddy, tune out the zealots</h2>
<p>Linux users aren’t as common as Windows users, but we’re out there. Chances are, you’ve got a colleague who also uses Linux. Having a buddy can be useful if you run into trouble. That buddy might even be in your university’s IT department, which might be useful if you need support.</p>

<p>A flipside of this: tune out zealots. Linux (and FOSS in general) can have folks getting quite pushy and judgy. If you use Ubuntu, someone might scoff and say “I use Arch.” Ignore these people.</p>

<h2 id="use-whatever-apps-you-need">Use whatever apps you need</h2>
<p>As I mentioned above, I’ve worked at Microsoft-dominated universities for my career. This means many of my colleagues use Teams, and Outlook is our provided email system. The good news is Teams works on Linux, and Outlook emails and calendaring can either be done online or with a FOSS client like <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/">Thunderbird</a>. Word documents and Powerpoint slides can be opened and edited with either an online editor or with <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a>.</p>

<p>There’s a Zoom client for Linux, too.</p>

<p>The bottom line is: even if you’re using Linux, you don’t have to entirely abandon applications if you need to use them.</p>

<p>I myself use these things, although I also consider myself a sort of experimenter, and I try to find FOSS alternatives, such as Nextcloud, to do the same tasks. No matter what task you’re trying to take care of, there’s probably a FOSS alternative that can help. But you <em>don’t</em> have to use the alternative in many cases. You can carry on using the apps you’re used to.</p>

<h2 id="live-the-dream">Live the dream</h2>
<p>With Linux installed, you can live the dream!</p>

<p>I call it the <strong>FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream.</strong> The benefits of using Linux and FOSS are many! Whenever I hear about Microsoft or Apple doing something weird, I can tune it out, because I now have so much more autonomy over my computers. Whenever I hear about this or that application selling off personal data or using it train AI without consent, I can tune that out, too – these things don’t happen with FOSS. I enjoy a lot more privacy and flexibility as I use my computers, and I’ve learned a lot, too.</p>

Microsoft has been doing lots of other things. Apparently these things have led to people not wanting to use Windows 11, the latest Windows – or even stop using Windows altogether. It seems people are upset – so much so, they are talking about switching to Linux. For those of you who are academics (or in related fields), I can tell you: the switch is entirely feasible. I’ve been using Linux since about 2008 or so to do my academic work. After writing three books with a fourth on the way, as well as nearly 30 peer-reviewed articles, I’d say it’s clear the work can be done with Linux. I should note I’m in the humanities, not computer science, so I’m using Linux mainly to write, research, and collaborate with other authors doing social science work. And it’s also important to note that I have worked at “Microsoft Campuses” for my whole career, meaning most of my colleagues use Windows and the IT folks support mostly Windows. In fact, when IT finds out I use Linux, they tend to say “We don’t officially support that” (and then they help as best they can). So I am definitely proof an academic can survive using Linux. Here, I want to talk a bit about my experience using Linux and Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) as an academic for the past two decades and toss in some tips for those thinking of switching. I hope it’s helpful, and if you have questions, let me know! (Also, before I begin: use whatever computer OS you like! I’m not judging!

I do several things in the book: provide some history, show the struggles of instance admins, talk about the politics of blocklists.</p>

<p>I also develop a concept in the book, “noncentralization.” In this blog post, I want to talk about what this means and contrast the term with the more popular one, “decentralization.” To do that, I want to contrast the fediverse with another system, Bluesky.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="decentralization-versus-noncentralization">Decentralization versus Noncentralization</h2>
<p>As I argue, the very term “decentralized” implies that there was once a center, something that has been broken up, <em>de</em>-centered. This process could work in reverse – something decentralized could be <em>re</em>-centralized at a later point. It might be hard to do, but it’s implied by the idea.</p>

<p>In contrast, <em>non</em>-centralized means just that: designed to avoid a center emerging. It’s a design goal from the outset. (Whether it is successful is another matter.)</p>

<p>I get this term from political philosophy, specifically federalism theory. As Glen Moots argues in <em><a href="https://www.routledge.com/The-Ashgate-Research-Companion-to-Federalism/Ward/p/book/9780367603021">The Ashgate Research Companion to Federalism</a></em>, in federalist political structures,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Power is diffused. Centralizing or concentrating power in a federalist system risks breaking the structure and spirit of the constitution. It negates the whole telos of federalism. Non-centralization applies to the United States, Canada, and Switzerland, for example. In each case, there is no central government that controls all the lines of political communication and decision-making. States, cantons, or provinces are not creatures of the federal government (Elazar 1984b 14).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We might argue whether or not the US or Canada is truly non-centralized. But the point Moots is making is that the ideal political structure envisioned by federalism doesn’t involve breaking up an existing center. As Moots writes, “decentralization implies the existence of a central authority that can decentralize or recentralize as it pleases.” Noncentralization by contrast involves designing political structures so that there are many, smaller locations where power is exercised. This allows for a high degree of local autonomy coupled with a larger-scale agreement about shared ethical values. (In the case of the fediverse, I call such a structure “the covenantal fediverse,” but that’s a topic for another post.)</p>

<p>Now, in my work on alternative social media, I’m not talking about states. I’m talking about social media. But given that social media must be governed (e.g., moderated, have policies), and given that we’re now living in a time of federated social media, I think it’s a good idea to look to federalist political theory to think about how things might work.</p>

<p>The two main projects seeking to federate social media today are the ActivityPub-based fediverse and Bluesky. Drawing on the noncentalized/decentralized distinction, I would argue that Bluesky is decentralized – and as such will never truly be federated. The ActivityPub-based fediverse is closer to the noncentalized ideal. But it is vulnerable to centralization, too.</p>

<h2 id="bluesky-and-decentralization">Bluesky and decentralization</h2>
<p>Bluesky has the ambition to be a decentralized Twitter. To that end, Bluesky has started out centralized and is slowly spinning out parts of itself from the center to the edges.</p>

<p>A simple example is support for GIFs. Bluesky has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bsky.app/post/3kqy4mjw5eo2t">proudly declared they now let people post GIFs</a>… <em>powered by Tenor</em>. What’s Tenor? It’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenor_(website)">Google-owned GIF repository and search engine</a> with <a href="https://tenor.com/gifapi/documentation">an API</a>. So people can “post” GIFs to Bluesky insofar as that means they pull in a GIF from another, centralized database of them and have it embedded in the stream.</p>

<p>In keeping with decentralization, Bluesky says that “custom GIFs” will be implemented later. I take that to mean they will allow uploading a .gif file from a local machine. You can’t do that now (I tried, and it just is a still image). So for now GIF posting is decentralized in that it involves two major services (Bluesky and Google’s Tenor), and in the future these centers might get broken up further.</p>

<p>It’s hard not to see this as symptomatic of Bluesky’s approach as a whole. It started out as one central service, Bsky.app, with the promise that people could run their own Personal Data Servers (PDSes) in the future (a future that is, to their credit, slowly happening).</p>

<p>But Bluesky distinguishes between “speech” and “reach,” meaning that while people can run their own PDSes and speak, their posts won’t appear across the network unless they are indexed or relayed – and Bluesky runs the only indexer. They promise that in the future that non-Bluesky employees can run indexers/relays, too, but that’s a costly proposition – much more so than running a PDS.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Bsky.app, the central Bluesky server, includes a connection to Twilio Segment, which is <a href="https://segment.com/">“The leading customer data platform, powered by CustomerAI”</a>.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/bskySegment.png" alt="A screenshot of my Noscript Firefox extension on bsky.app, showing Segment.com as a source for a script" />
  <figcaption>A screenshot of my Noscript Firefox extension on bsky.app, showing Segment.com as a source for a script</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Segment’s presence on the site raises the specter of behavioral advertising – a possibility the company has never denied. Consider this Q and A between <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/bluesky-ceo-jay-graber-wont-enshittify-ads/">Bluesky CEO Jay Graber and <em>WIRED</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Are you thinking about advertisements at all?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There will always be free options, and we can’t enshittify the network with ads. This is where federation comes in. The fact that anyone can self-host and anyone can build on the software means that we’ll never be able to degrade the user experience in a way where people want to leave.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s not a “no.” It’s hard to understand exactly what it is.</p>

<p>It might be, “we won’t do ads.” But then what’s the Segment integration for? Segment’s presence might just mean Bluesky will sell data to marketers but not allow ads. (After all, brands are certainly welcome on Bluesky and may want insights into their audiences.)</p>

<p>Or, it might be, “if we do ads <em>wrong</em> people will leave, so we better do them right.” That seems likely given the Segment integration.</p>

<p>Or maybe Graber’s answer means, “if we do allow ads, people can just move to another PDS and appview.” That is, we can run ads on our PDS/appview, but others may decide not to.</p>

<p>In any case, if the costs of running Bluesky infrastructure can be partially subsidized by ads or other behavioral marketing techniques (without “enshittifying” everything), then most likely there will be one central mechanism by which anyone wishing to subsidize their part of the network (e.g., a distinct PDS) can do so. If Bluesky runs this monetization system, then de facto third-party PDSes that use it will be closely tied to the center.</p>

<p>Decentralization also holds when we consider the underlying protocol Bluesky is making, ATProto, That’s being done by them alone. They promise it will be transferred to a standards body (e.g., the IETF) in the future so that it is more open. It could be that they do this, but it would replicate the pattern: they start with a center and then decentralize. The protocol will be made in-house, and even after being moved to something like the IETF, it can be dominated by Bluesky the company.</p>

<p>Overall, Bluesky is decentralized in the sense I’m using it here: there’s a center that’s being broken up. This might turn out for the best. <a href="https://steveklabnik.com/writing/how-does-bluesky-work">Steve Klabnik’s explainer</a> has a similar (if more sanguine) take:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…the BlueSky team has demonstrated, in my personal opinion, enough understanding and uncomfortableness with being in control here, and it’s designed in such a way that if other, better systems develop, you can move to them. They’ve also indicated that moving governance of did:plc to some sort of consensus model in the future is possible. There are options. Also, others could run a did:plc service and use that instead if they prefer, too.
I personally see this as an example of pragmatically shipping something, others see it as a nefarious plot. You’ll have to decide for yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it’s a pragmatic choice to do everything centrally, ship it now, and devolve it to the edges over time.</p>

<p>But it seems to me that, no matter what, much will continue to flow to the center, either on purpose or through inertia. And edge-parts that misbehave (by Bluesky’s standards) might be recallable to the center. For example, if allowing just anyone to run an indexer causes problems down the road, Bluesky’s control could be re-asserted later.</p>

<h2 id="noncentralization-and-the-fediverse">Noncentralization and the fediverse</h2>
<p>I would argue that the ActivityPub-based fediverse is much closer to the noncentalized ideal I would prefer. By “fediverse” I mean the ActivityPub-based fediverse.</p>

<p>How?</p>

<p>Well, for one thing, there’s a whole host of different projects. From PeerTube to the Wordpress plugin, it’s a network of heterogenous social media services. ActivityPub allows for a range of technologies. Moreover, ActivityPub is already an open standard – it was that way from day 1. It supports a bewildering array of social media projects.</p>

<p>Now, you might argue “Mastodon is dominant.” Yes, Mastodon is dominant, but it’s not the only game in town. And even <em>if</em> the fediverse was mostly Mastodon, what does that mean? There are forks of Mastodon (Glitch, Hometown) and heavily modified Mastodon installations (awoo.space). Mastodon isn’t one thing – it’s many things.</p>

<p>You might say that there are points of centralization at the instance level: that an instance is a center. But they are not central to the network. There are tens of thousands of them, ranging from instances-of-one to large instances. And there’s no guarantee they will connect – they might have ethical disagreements. The smallest instance can block the biggest one. Indeed, that’s why instance blocking exists.</p>

<p>Now, you might say, “What about Threads?” And <em>that</em> is a concern of mine. The existing fediverse is so small that the appearance of a corporate-controlled network with 100 million+ accounts means that de facto there is now a center. That is indeed a problem.</p>

<p>There are solutions, though. One is #<a href="https://fedipact.online/">fedipact-like agreements</a> to block Meta. I endorse this. In my view, the whole point of federated, alternative social media is to be a better alternative to corporate social media, not a means to connect to it.</p>

<p>Another approach to Threads is to hope other big companies get involved in the fediverse to balance things out with Meta. With Meta here, let’s get Apple and Google and Microsoft to adopt ActivityPub. To cite Evan Prodromou, that’s a <a href="https://evanp.me/2023/12/26/big-fedi-small-fedi/">“Big Fedi” solution</a>.</p>

<p>I don’t like this solution, because I would rather see the fediverse be comprised of tens or even hundreds of thousands of small, self-governing communities. That would be closest to a noncentalized ideal: it remains a system where there was no center in the first place, where many small communities band together into a big network through mutual, shared ethical values, and any attempt to centralize will be resisted.</p>

<h2 id="bluesky-wont-be-federated">Bluesky won’t be federated</h2>
<p>Reading the documents and discourses, it’s clear to me Bluesky won’t be federated – it will be decentralized. It won’t be federated because it won’t be noncentralized. It is not being designed that way, and I do not believe it will ever be that way. Some of its centers are going to hold, which negates the idea of distributing power and control. And those things that are spun out to the edges could be recallable in particular ways.</p>

<p>The fediverse is closer to the ideal of noncentralization, but of course Threads indicates that such a thing is fragile. Designing a noncentralized system is hard work, and it can fail.</p>]]></content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="Bluesky" /><category term="Fediverse" /><category term="Goal 2" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m nearing wrapping up drafting Move Slowly and Build Bridges, my book about the fediverse.

As the government’s website describes it,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The internet is an exceptional tool for people of all ages to learn, play and connect with family, friends and those with similar interests. However, just like the outside world, the digital world can pose significant dangers. Social media can be used to sexually exploit children, promote self-harm to children, incite violence, put people’s safety at risk and foment hate. Online harms have real-world impacts with tragic, even fatal, consequences.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Government of Canada has introduced legislation to hold social media platforms accountable for addressing harmful content on their platforms and for creating a safer online space that protects all people in Canada, especially kids.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As something that addresses speech on the internet – and includes some strong penalties for spreading hate speech – the Act has led to massive debates. I won’t summarize them here, but you can read thoughtful critiques from <a href="https://www.michaelgeist.ca/tag/online-harms-act/">Professor Michael Geist</a> and you can listen to a discussion on <a href="https://www.canadaland.com/podcast/85-the-hate-u-post/">Canadaland’s Backbench</a> to get a sense of things.</p>

<p>My interest here is not to delve into the controversies, but instead read the Act while wearing my Mastodon admin hat. I am one of the two admins of AoIR.social, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(social_network)">Mastodon</a> instance for members of the <a href="https://aoir.org/">Association of Internet Researchers</a>. AoIR.social gives our members access to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">the fediverse</a> – the global network of thousands of social media servers, with millions of users engaged in social media activities.</p>

<p>An initial question: does the Act apply to the tens of thousands of fediverse instances with their millions of users? Does it thus apply to AoIR.social? Considering that the Act defines “social media service” as “a website or application that is accessible in Canada, the primary purpose of which is to facilitate interprovincial or international online communication among users of the website or application by enabling them to access and share content” (page 5), then the answer is yes. AoIR.social operates internationally, including in Canada. So do many of the other tens of thousands of fediverse servers.</p>

<p>Since I’m one of the two admins of AoIR.social, am I affected? I believe so: I would be an “operator,” “a person that, through any means, operates a regulated service.” It could also be that the AoIR organization itself would be the operator, since in this Act “person” also applies to corporations.</p>

<p>The Act would create a Digital Safety Commission, an agency that would govern social media services. The Act notes this Commission should consider things like the size of the service and the operator’s financial and technical abilities. This is good – many fediverse instances are small and are run by individuals or a handful of folks. They also often run on very small budgets as not-for-profit organizations. Regardless, however, I believe small fediverse servers would be affected (unless they find a way to not be available to Canadians).</p>

<p>So: will the Act radically affect fediverse instances, such as AoIR.social? The Act specifically says our service should not harm freedom of expression, and reading it leads me to believe that AoIR.social won’t be affected in that manner. While we welcome debate and discussion, we’re not in the business of platforming the sorts of harmful content the Act discusses.</p>

<p>But, the implementation of the Act could prove to be very burdensome to the administration of fediverse instances, such as AoIR.social. Much is going to hinge on how the Act understands the fediverse.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="duties-of-operators-of-regulated-services">Duties of Operators of Regulated Services</h2>
<p>The Act is meant to regulate social media, and it lays out various duties social media service operators must follow.</p>

<p>The first is the duty to act responsibly: “The operator of a regulated service must implement measures that are adequate to mitigate the risk that users of the service will be exposed to harmful content on the service.”  Another is a duty to protect children, and related to both, there’s also the duty to make harmful content inaccessible to Canadians.</p>

<p>As a fediverse admin, I have two key questions about these duties. First, what is “harmful content”? This is defined on page 4 in the definitions section:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“(a) intimate content communicated without consent;</li>
  <li>(b) content that sexually victimizes a child or revictimizes a survivor;</li>
  <li>(c) content that induces a child to harm themselves;</li>
  <li>(d) content used to bully a child;</li>
  <li>(e) content that foments hatred;</li>
  <li>(f) content that incites violence; and</li>
  <li>(g) content that incites violent extremism or terrorism.”</li>
</ul>

<p>So, things like revenge “porn”, child sexual abuse material, hate speech, and terrorist speech are prohibited. There are definitions offered for each of these, so I won’t define them here. Frankly, I have no problem blocking these things.</p>

<p>The other question I have is about the responsibility to “mitigate the risk that users of the service will be exposed to harmful content….” It seems to me that this is not just about removing content that’s posted. It’s about reducing the likelihood AoIR.social members will see such harmful content.</p>

<p><em>This</em> is where I have a lot of concerns. Some things seem easy to do, but there are other things that I’m not sure about.</p>

<p>Put simply, the TL;DR summary of the issue is: does the Act consider something like a fediverse server an independent social media site? Or would the Act see the fediverse as a singular network, with traffic being load-balanced across multiple servers?</p>

<p>Let’s get into the details.</p>

<h2 id="whats-easily-done">What’s Easily Done</h2>
<p>The Act calls for social media to publish “Guidelines.” These “must be accessible and easy to use and must include (a) a standard of conduct that applies to users with respect to harmful content; and (b) a description of the measures that the operator implements with respect to harmful content on the service.”</p>

<p>This is pretty easy to comply with, because like many other Mastodon instances, <a href="https://aoir.social/about">AoIR.social has a code of conduct</a>. I believe our code is “accessible and easy to use,” and it explicitly establishes a standard of conduct, which includes prohibitions on the sorts of content the Act describes.</p>

<p>The Act also calls for social media to provide users with “tools to block users” – done and done, because this was baked into Mastodon from its early days.</p>

<p>And the duty to protect children is quite easy for AoIR.social since our membership is limited to dues-paying members of the Association of Internet Researchers, and I don’t think that population includes anyone under 20, let alone minors.</p>

<h2 id="whats-less-clear">What’s Less Clear</h2>
<h3 id="tools-and-processes-to-flag-harmful-content">Tools and processes to flag harmful content</h3>
<p>One feature called for is to “enable a user to easily flag to the operator content that is accessible on the service as being a particular type of harmful content.” That’s baked into Mastodon, so easy enough.</p>

<p>But some of it is not as easy to do, such as “notify a user who flagged content as being a particular type of harmful content of the operator’s receipt of the flag as well as of any measures taken by the operator with respect to the content or of the fact that no measures were taken.” Mastodon does not automatically do this, so it would have to be something the admin/mod does on their own. On AoIR.social, if a user flags something and we block it, we don’t really bother to go back to the original flagger and say we did so. We just do it and move on. I suppose we can do the extra step, but it will add work.</p>

<p>But some of it seems misguided to me: “notify a user who communicated content that was flagged as being a particular type of harmful content of the fact that the content was flagged as well as of any measures taken by the operator with respect to the content or of the fact that no measures were taken.” Mastodon <em>definitely</em> does not do this. I believe this is by design, because notifying people that they have had their content removed can invite more harassment. The approach on Mastodon is to block and not really let the blocked person know. I believe this is for safety purposes –- if we block someone’s content and tell them, they might harass us.</p>

<p>That’s not likely to happen if it’s an AoIR.social member. But the big issue is: <strong>does the Act require me to do these actions with people who are not on my server?</strong> If this is all meant to take place <em>within</em> my server, it’s probably not a problem. Most such in-server moderation is going to involve a discussion with the “user who communicated content that was flagged.” In the case of a user who posts something abhorrent, they’re going to be booted. In the case of someone who posts something borderline, we’re going to chat about it. It’s not going to be a formal process, but more personal.</p>

<p>However, if this is meant to govern my interactions with a user on a server <em>outside</em> my instance, I don’t think this is wise, and it could backfire. If, for example, some trolls are harassing people on AoIR.social, I might communicate with them to tell them to stop, but most likely I’m just going to block them (and hence remove their posts) and not explain myself. Explaining myself would probably lead to more harassment, both for the original victim and likely for me or other AoIR.social moderators.</p>

<p>How the Act handles this is going to matter. If the Act looks at the fediverse and sees a bunch of independent servers which can connect to one another and can sever those connections but have no power over each other, that’s fine. (This is how I think of the fediverse). I can moderate my own server easily enough, and even with the Act in force, the moderation burden might not change all that much (depending on how it is implemented – see below).</p>

<p>If, however, the Act sees a large social media network that distributes the load across multiple resources, then it’s going to raise a great deal of problems for admins like myself. It’s going to create big burdens – and could even lead to more harmful speech.</p>

<h3 id="digital-safety-plan">Digital Safety Plan</h3>
<p>The issue with how the Act would see the fediverse is really intense when it comes to the Digital Safety Plan section. “The operator of a regulated service must submit a digital safety plan to the [Digital Safety] Commission in respect of each regulated service that it operates,” the Act states.</p>

<p>The details are going to matter a great deal here. As someone attempting to immigrate to Canada, I have some familiarity with Canadian bureaucracy. Much of it is quite straightforward, but some of it is onerous and confusing. If AoIR.social will have to supply such a plan, what will it entail? How will it be submitted? Will it be like getting my social insurance number (which was super easy) or like going through the work permit process (which was pretty labor-intensive)?</p>

<p>Looking at the details, I have concerns. For example is point G of the Digital Safety Plan, which would ask me to report</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>information respecting (i) the number of times that content that was accessible on the service was flagged to the operator by users of the service as being harmful content, including the number of flags relating to each type of harmful content, (ii) the manner in which the operator triaged and assessed the flags, (iii) measures taken by the operator with respect to content that was flagged as being harmful content, and (iv) the time within which the operator took measures with respect to content that was flagged as being harmful content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would be easy enough – again, <em>if it’s limited to my server.</em> AoIR.social members are a collegial, professional lot. I simply don’t expect any of them to post harmful content, and thus I don’t expect to have to often report that they flagged content on our own server. And maybe this would be the case. I can indeed interpret the Act’s “users of the service” to be limited to AoIR.social members.</p>

<p>But this does raise a separate potential problem. If the Act sees the fediverse as a bunch of independent servers, what happens when someone outside my server flags something on my server? For the sake of argument, let’s say AoIR.social is actually a bad actor on the fediverse, and our members share harmful content regularly, and that we don’t report each other (since we all agree with our harmful content-sharing project). Could we simply ignore the pleas of people outside our server to cut it out? Could our Digital Safety Plan simply say, “we didn’t get reports”? The Act has penalties for such things, but it would require someone outside our server to report us to the Commission who would then have to investigate. Meanwhile, we’re gleefully sharing harmful content (in this hypothetical example).</p>

<p>So, maybe the Act should require me (and other fedi instances) to document flags I get from outside my server – that is, maybe the Act <em>should</em> see the fediverse as one large network.</p>

<p>But if the Act requires me to document flags coming from outside my server, I could also imagine another problem: being burdened by reporting on malicious or coordinated flagging from outside one’s server. I would have to write up reports for those flags, even if they are done in bad faith. There is language about my being able to ignore “vexatious” or “frivolous” flags, but do I have document them, anyway, to prove that all the reports were, indeed, vexatious?</p>

<p>Taken as a whole, I think the Act should treat each instance as an independent entity.</p>

<h3 id="duty-to-make-certain-content-inaccessible">Duty to Make Certain Content Inaccessible</h3>
<p>Subsection 67 of the Act says that if an operator finds material that exploits children or revictimizes an adult, or finds nonconsensual materials (e.g., revenge “porn”), the operator has to block it and tell the person that it’s blocked. This has to be done in 24 hours.</p>

<p>Obviously, I 100% support this. AoIR.social would act with the swiftness if a member posts such material.</p>

<p>But again, the details are going to matter, and the way the Act understands the fediverse is going to be important. If I block content from another server – not my own – do I have to inform the creator of the content, who did so on the other server? Because that sort of thing often leads to harassment of moderators. I or one of the AoIR.social moderators might get targeted by the sort of person who would maliciously share such content.</p>

<p>The next point, subsection 68, discusses “trivial, frivolous, vexatious” or “bad faith” flags, stating operators can ignore those.</p>

<p>That’s good.</p>

<p>But: “If the operator dismisses the flag, it must, within the period that applies under subsection (5), notify the user who flagged the content of the dismissal.” Again, this is pretty problematic if it’s someone outside my server. The sort of person who submits trivial or vexatious reports is not the sort of person who is going to simply walk away when an admin or mod says to stop.</p>

<h3 id="the-appeals-process">The Appeals Process</h3>

<p>The question of whether I am responsible for reaching out to people on other servers or not is intensified by the “Representations” section (subsection 69), which describes a sort of appeals process:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If the operator of a regulated service makes content inaccessible under subsection 67(1) or 68(3), the operator must, within the period provided for by regulations, give the user who communicated the content on the service and the user who flagged the content, if applicable, an opportunity to make representations as to whether the content is content that sexually victimizes a child or revictimizes a survivor or intimate content communicated without consent.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I’m required to communicate with someone sharing CSAM on another server and ask them to justify their doing so (representing that it is actually OK to share), I will definitely be burdened. I simply want to block them. Or more likely block their server for engaging in poor moderation. I don’t want to negotiate the finer points of CSAM with people who share it.</p>

<p>This is compounded by the “Reconsideration Upon Request” (point 70): “At the request of the user who communicated the content on the service or the user who flagged the content, the operator of a regulated service must reconsider a decision that it made under subsection 69(2).” If I am asked to do this work with someone outside my server, then a full process could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consider it and judge it</li>
  <li>communicate with the CSAM provider (“Hey, is this really CSAM?”)</li>
  <li>Hear them out</li>
  <li>Decide</li>
  <li>Reconsider upon request</li>
  <li>Decide</li>
  <li>Reconsider again (“Reconsideration” is mentioned twice)</li>
</ul>

<p>This strikes me as pretty burdensome, as well as a vector for harassment.</p>

<p>And this is not just if the Act sees the fedi as one big network. It could lead to harassment if the Act sees fedi instances as independent, too.</p>

<p>Here’s how: the Act includes the appeals process, because if the Act requires a company like Meta to block stuff without any chance of appeal, that’s problematic, since Meta is going to use automated moderation and will make tons of mistakes.</p>

<p>But for small fediverse instances, I don’t really think a government-mandated appeals process is necessary, nor wanted. Most well-moderated fedi instances are just going to remove accounts of people who post harmful stuff. No appeals. No tolerance. They’re not courts of law. The approach many fedi admins take is: if you want to post X content, you’re free to do so on another server. Does the Act give a bad actor the right to appeal the decision of a fedi admin? I really, really hope not. It would be burdensome and actually cause more harm than good.</p>

<h3 id="duty-to-keep-records">Duty to Keep Records</h3>
<p>Finally, let’s consider subsection 72: “The operator of a regulated service must keep all records, including information and data, that are necessary to determine whether the operator is complying with the operator’s duties under this Act.”</p>

<p>Depending on how the Act is implemented, this could be quite burdensome to operators of small servers. <em>Even if</em> the Act sees fedi instances as independent, I don’t really see the benefits of my keeping records on all my decisions. Do I need to record the date and time every time I block an account or outside instance? Do I need to screenshot every time someone flags something?</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In my view, I completely understand the rationale behind the Online Harms Act: I believe corporate social media ought to be regulated. However, I am concerned that, in writing these regulations, the Act’s authors may place some undue burdens on the emerging fediverse, which is comprised of tens of thousands of small servers around the world. If the Act’s authors understand fediverse servers to be independent entities, then the Act <em>might</em> not be so burdensome. If the Act sees the fediverse itself as a large social media network, problems compound. I’m not a lawyer but I believe that the Act is more likely to have the former interpretation.</p>

<p>But even if so, the Act could still burden small, self-funded social media sites by asking already overworked moderators and admins to do more work (or hire/recruit someone specifically to deal with these regulations). If so, the Act’s burdens could happen at a bad time, because the fediverse is starting to emerge as a viable alternative to corporate social media – the very thing the Act is no doubt attempting to address.</p>]]></content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="Online Harms Act" /><category term="Mastodon" /><category term="Fediverse" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Online Harms Act is currently the talk of Canada. As the government’s website describes it, The internet is an exceptional tool for people of all ages to learn, play and connect with family, friends and those with similar interests. However, just like the outside world, the digital world can pose significant dangers. Social media can be used to sexually exploit children, promote self-harm to children, incite violence, put people’s safety at risk and foment hate. Online harms have real-world impacts with tragic, even fatal, consequences. The Government of Canada has introduced legislation to hold social media platforms accountable for addressing harmful content on their platforms and for creating a safer online space that protects all people in Canada, especially kids. As something that addresses speech on the internet – and includes some strong penalties for spreading hate speech – the Act has led to massive debates. I won’t summarize them here, but you can read thoughtful critiques from Professor Michael Geist and you can listen to a discussion on Canadaland’s Backbench to get a sense of things. My interest here is not to delve into the controversies, but instead read the Act while wearing my Mastodon admin hat. I am one of the two admins of AoIR.social, a Mastodon instance for members of the Association of Internet Researchers. AoIR.social gives our members access to the fediverse – the global network of thousands of social media servers, with millions of users engaged in social media activities. An initial question: does the Act apply to the tens of thousands of fediverse instances with their millions of users? Does it thus apply to AoIR.social? Considering that the Act defines “social media service” as “a website or application that is accessible in Canada, the primary purpose of which is to facilitate interprovincial or international online communication among users of the website or application by enabling them to access and share content” (page 5), then the answer is yes. AoIR.social operates internationally, including in Canada. So do many of the other tens of thousands of fediverse servers. Since I’m one of the two admins of AoIR.social, am I affected? I believe so: I would be an “operator,” “a person that, through any means, operates a regulated service.” It could also be that the AoIR organization itself would be the operator, since in this Act “person” also applies to corporations. The Act would create a Digital Safety Commission, an agency that would govern social media services. The Act notes this Commission should consider things like the size of the service and the operator’s financial and technical abilities. This is good – many fediverse instances are small and are run by individuals or a handful of folks. They also often run on very small budgets as not-for-profit organizations. Regardless, however, I believe small fediverse servers would be affected (unless they find a way to not be available to Canadians). So: will the Act radically affect fediverse instances, such as AoIR.social? The Act specifically says our service should not harm freedom of expression, and reading it leads me to believe that AoIR.social won’t be affected in that manner. While we welcome debate and discussion, we’re not in the business of platforming the sorts of harmful content the Act discusses. But, the implementation of the Act could prove to be very burdensome to the administration of fediverse instances, such as AoIR.social. Much is going to hinge on how the Act understands the fediverse.]]></summary></entry></feed>
