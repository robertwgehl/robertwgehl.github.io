<p>It all started when I saw the news that Meta had <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-meta-zuckerberg-inauguration-donation-c540bf7c638def11b8428e633965c718">donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund</a>. Look, I’m an American. I know how this works – the wealthy buy influence by giving to politicians. It’s not particularly shocking to see Meta doing this – it’s part of their longstanding practices of lobbying those in power so they can continue to operate with little to no regulations.</p>

<p>But it simply reaffirms my desire to explore the world of communication outside the control of a handful of corporations.</p>

<p>Searching for coverage of Meta’s donation led me to a bit of a rabbit hole of recent news about Meta’s Threads. Much of it comes from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/">The Verge</a>, and most of it is about Threads’s moderation failures.</p>

<p>Since Threads is slowly rolling out ActivityPub capabilities, this ASM Update about Threads does have a lot of relevance to the fediverse.</p>

<p>The TL;DR version is: after taking a second look, I continue to see Meta’s Threads as a bad actor and <a href="https://fedipact.online/">worthy of being blocked</a> by the rest of the fediverse.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="californian-ideology-at-scale">Californian Ideology at Scale</h2>
<p>Writing in the aforementioned <em>Verge</em>, <a href="https://fedipact.online/">Adam Heath reports</a> that Meta is now double-thinking their previous moderation practices. The story is nominally about how Meta was overactive in moderating during the COVID pandemic (though Meta blames Biden for that) as well as about how Meta’s automated moderation systems are too “ham-fisted.”</p>

<p>But the real problem is not explicitly stated. See if you can find it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nick Clegg, Meta’s president of global affairs, told reporters on Monday that the company’s moderation “error rates are still too high” and pledged to “improve the precision and accuracy with which we act on our rules.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’re probably thinking I’m going to critique the fact that Meta hired Nick Clegg, but as I said, I’m an American, so I know little of him other than he helped raise tuition fees in the UK and helped preside over Brexit.</p>

<p>No, my issue is with the title “president of global affairs.”</p>

<p>I find it inconceivable that any corporation can engage in content moderation on a global scale. This is particularly apparent to me after experiencing the fediverse, where content moderation is achieved at a local level on a small scale. Meta, X, TikTok: all attempt to impose their corporate standards on all the world. Perhaps we can come up with global standards and ethics – but the vehicle for doing it won’t be through top-down, for-profit corporate behemoths.</p>

<h2 id="too-big-to-comprehend">Too Big to Comprehend</h2>
<p>As a result of attempting the impossible task of moderating the globe, Meta has grown to be huge and complex. It’s so big we need dedicated watchdogs. We need <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266096/instagram-threads-moderation-account-post-deleted-limited">investigative journalists</a> to report on trends in corporate social media, including trends about poor moderation.</p>

<p>Indeed, Meta is so big that its own executives don’t know what’s going on. Consider this exchange on Threads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Social media consultant Matt Navarra — who was notified his Threads account is getting downranked after sharing a story about how Tom Brady fell for a Meta AI hoax — got a response to his public complaint from Mosseri. “Looking into it…” Mosseri said. Meta didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the system is so opaque the head of Instagram/Threads, Adam Mosseri, can’t figure it out… well.</p>

<p>Again, contrast this with the fediverse. On my previous instance, if I had a problem, I could contact the admin directly. I didn’t need to post publicly and hope the admin saw it. (On my current instance, AoIR.social, I <em>am</em> the admin, so people contact me for help.) The fediverse, at its best, is a far less abstracted, human system.</p>

<h2 id="bots-cant-moderate">Bots can’t Moderate</h2>

<p>Speaking of humans, Meta is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1584908458516247/">increasingly using bots to moderate</a>. Unsurprisingly, this results in arbitrary decisions.</p>

<p>That’s the main complaint of posts tagged <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mikethebearded/post/DA2D_C4yaya">“Threads Moderation Failures,”</a> which has been steadily documenting the weird and wild world of AI-based content moderation. For a corporation already incapable of understanding what its own moderation practices are (“I’ll look into it!”), ceding more and more moderation decisions to AI seems like a bad choice.</p>

<p>We could ask Meta hire more humans to do the job, but then again… some of the last humans who did that work were summarily <a href="https://jacobin.com/2024/02/kenya-courts-meta-content-moderation-union">fired after trying to unionize</a>.</p>

<h2 id="your-voice-our-vote">Your Voice, Our Vote</h2>
<p>But perhaps all of this will be made right once Thread users have their voices heard via a <a href="https://www.threads.net/@oncescuradu/post/DDfgI0_o_3Y">survey on content moderation</a>. Since Meta attempts to moderate a global scale, perhaps getting tons of input from its users might shed light on how to tackle that task. The survey appears to ask about users’ attitudes towards sharing on Threads – whether or not they feel inhibited from sharing because they fear being “penalized.”</p>

<p>Maybe Threads will learn from the survey and improve their moderation?</p>

<p>I have my doubts. I’ve seen Facebook/Meta do this sort of faux popular polling throughout its history. As <a href="https://archive.org/details/UnlikeUs/page/n223/mode/2up">I wrote back in the early 2010s</a>, Facebook often held votes on changes to their Terms of Service agreements and, no matter the vote, they adopted the TOS they intended to the whole time.</p>

<p>Might they do the same with their Threads content moderation survey? Who knows? Their content moderation decisions are so opaque that it would be impossible to tell, anyway. I believe the real goal is to keep their metaphorical shopping mall aesthetic intact, and to keep regulators at bay. And probably to justify their cost-cutting AI-based moderation practices.</p>

<h2 id="you-block-me-no-way-man-no-way-i-block-you">You Block Me? No way, man. No, way. I block you!</h2>
<p>All of the above has renewed my belief that AoIR.social’s decision to preemptively block Threads (and sign <a href="https://fedipact.online/">the fedipact</a>) was the right decision. AoIR.social is a Mastodon instance I help run. We provide federated social media to members of the <a href="https://aoir.org/">Association of Internet Researchers</a>, a group of folks who have a pretty good idea about how Meta operates.</p>

<p>But I am a bit disappointed our block isn’t mutual. Readers might recall I wrote about Threads’s Fediverse Blocklist – their own list of blocked servers. I first looked at it <a href="/2024/06/28/ThreadsBlocking.html">six months ago</a>. I checked it again today – it has grown from 660 back in June to 843 today.</p>

<p>As I wrote back in June, many of the blocks make total sense. But some don’t. I mentioned Scholar.social as one that does not need to be blocked. Another one that’s been blocked this whole time is Writeout.ink, which is a small server with a clear code of conduct.</p>

<p>Another one that doesn’t – and was added to the list between June and now – is Darius Kazemi’s Friend.camp, the flagship Hometown server. The reason Threads’s blocklist offers is “no public timeline.” I asked Darius about it, and he says that’s true, but he thinks it’s been true for some time now.</p>

<p>And surely there are many many more servers without public timelines than 800. So why is Friend.camp blocked? Maybe it’s because Friend.camp blocks Threads. “We federated with threads for a long time but we defederated a few months ago based on user consensus,” Darius told me. So maybe blocking Threads triggered a mutual block?</p>

<p>But… AoIR.social blocks Threads! And we’re not on the list! What do I have to do to get AoIR.social blocked by Threads? I kinda want that badge of honor.</p>

<p>In all seriousness, while I praised Threads for publicly posting its blocklist, noting this is a very transparent move, it’s still pretty opaque how they’re making these choices. Just as Threads is being criticized by its users for clumsy AI-based moderation decisions, I anticipate Threads will automatically and arbitrarily block a fediverse server that does not deserve it but whose members really do want to connect to folks on Threads. I don’t see Threads putting a lot of effort into making informed blocking decisions. That’s not what Meta does. And for those instances that want to federate with Meta, be prepared to behave how Meta says – and even if you do, you may be arbitrarily blocked. And be prepared to <a href="https://help.instagram.com/contact/1574148669814359/">fill out a form and hope</a> that someone, somewhere considers your case.</p>

<p>If people are going to use blocklists – and <a href="/2023/09/20/blocklists.html">I think they should</a> – they need to be managed by people on behalf of coherent communities. Not by robots on behalf of a profit-seeking corporation. And they need to be documents that networks of communities gather around to discuss how to build out a federated network. Not dictated to the network by a powerful node.</p>]]></content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="Threads" /><category term="ASM update" /><category term="moderation" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week’s Alternative Social Media Update turned out to be more of a critique of corporate social media, specifically Meta’s Threads.

<p>Previously, <a href="/2024/12/01/marp.html">I wrote about Marp</a>, which is a <a href="https://marp.app/">Markdown-based way to generate presentation slides</a>. When I wrote about Marp last, I was speculating that it would be very useful:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m going to do it: I’m going all-on on Marp for a while….  I suspect Marp is a future fixture of the FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, it’s true. On Friday, I gave a presentation over Zoom using a Marp-based slide deck. You can <a href="https://robertwgehl.org/presentations/ITS_presentation.html">see the files here</a>. It worked wonderfully!</p>

<p>And I did something more. Marp produces responsive, semantic HTML. HTML can be parsed with <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">BeautifulSoup</a>, a Python library.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Marp enables me to easily add slide notes with basic HTML comments, like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;!-- Slide notes go here --&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After Marp processes the Markdown file and converts it into HTML, I could see that those comments with a class, “bespoke-marp-note.” Which means I could pull out all the notes directly from the HTML and create a new file, with the notes only, with BeautifulSoup.</p>

<p>I’m no programmer, but I can search for guides with the best of them. I wrote a python script to pull the comments and produce a second HTML with just my script. <a href="https://robertwgehl.org/presentations/ITS_presentationText.html">Here’s the result</a>.</p>

<p>This gives me a great time-saver: instead of writing a script and creating the slides separately, I just do it all in one Markdown file, and the scripts generate everything I need from that single file. This will save hours of work!</p>

<p>Another nice thing about this is that I can share the text of my presentation easily over the web. Prior to this, I rewrote the presentation as a new Markdown file and posted it to the blog. That would add hours to the task. The new way will be automated!</p>

<p>Here’s the Pyton script I wrote (if you see poor coding on my part, be gentle):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as BS
from bs4 import Comment


import requests
import getopt, sys

# This gets the system argument, which should be the Markdown file I'm exporting
filename = sys.argv[1]

# strips the final three characters, '.md', from the file name
filename = filename[:-3]

# changes file name for text
filenameText = filename + 'Text.html'

print(filenameText)

# adding local HTML file
with open(filename + '.html') as f:
    soup = BS(f, 'html.parser')

# parsing notes
# this will add a header, print to file

i = 0
presentation = (soup.find('h1'))
content = '''&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;'''
content += str(presentation)

# this will add slide headers and the notes

for note in soup.find_all(class_='bespoke-marp-note'):
  i += 1
  content += '&lt;h2&gt;Slide ' + str(i) + '&lt;/h2&gt;'
  content += str(note)
content += '''
&lt;!-- Some javascript here --&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
'''

# Writing the content to an HTML file
with open(str(filenameText), 'w') as file:
    file.write(content)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You might notice a variable, “filename = sys.argv[1]”. That is there because I wrote a bash script, exportPresentation.sh, to automate the whole export process:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#!/bin/bash
~/.local/share/marp/marp --theme ./CSS/custom.scss --html $1
python pullComments.py "$1"

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That little script invokes marp-cli to convert the Markdown file, and then the python script recieves the file name (e.g., I’d type “sh exportPresentation.sh presentation.md” into the shell).</p>

<p>Again, much like using CSS to build a presentation, coming up with these scripts took a bit of time, but in the long run, I’m making presentation creation – and sharing! – that much easier.</p>]]></content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="Marp" /><category term="beautifulsoup" /><category term="goal 1" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream just got a bit dreamier.

  <p>In the wake of recent crises at commercial social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit, the “fediverse” has gained adoption and visibility as a noncommercial alternative for individuals, communities, and institutions to develop channels of public communication, dialogue, and debate. In this article, we draw on illustrative examples from the history of digital civic discourse and identify 6 ways in which history shows us how the potential benefits of the fediverse are at risk of subversion. We discuss several potential threats to these spaces of civil discourse, including challenges inherent to distributed governance, commercial platform capture, inclusive access, moderation at scale, reputational assaults by commercial competitors, and the neoliberal technoromanticism familiar from previous digital innovations. These threats must be addressed collectively and proactively by key fediverse stakeholders in an ecology whose ruling values are noncommercialism, decentralization, open source, free association, and wariness of traditional governance.</p>

I use Nextcloud to manage files and <a href="/2021/09/25/Appointments.html">handle appointments</a>, Zotero and Zettlr to take notes, and LibreOffice Writer to write books and articles. This blog runs on Jekyll. I love it all!</p>

<p>But there has been one part of the Lifestyle that has consistently been a disappointment: <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/impress/">LibreOffice Impress</a>, the presentation software. While I use Writer all the time and enjoy doing so, Impress has always bothered me. But I’m not one to complain too much, since LibreOffice software is provided free-of-charge and with a FOSS license. I’ve soldiered on with it to make presentations for conferences and class teaching.</p>

<p>But that might change. <a href="https://marp.app/">Marp</a> – the Markdown Presentation Ecosystem – is poised to become a key part of the FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream. If you’re familiar with Markdown, Marp is a really awesome tool.
<!-- more --></p>

<h2 id="thank-you-linux-matters">Thank you, Linux Matters</h2>
<p>I learned about Marp from the <a href="https://linuxmatters.sh/43/"><em>Linux Matters</em> podcast</a>. Like any good podcast episode, their discussion of Marp made me drop everything to learn more. As Mark on <em>Linux Matters</em> explained, Marp allows for presentations to be built very quickly using Markdown. Since I use Markdown regularly to write up notes, particularly for class lectures, I was intrigued.</p>

<p>And when I started experimenting with Marp, I think Mark might have undersold it a bit!</p>

<h2 id="markdown-its-that-easy">Markdown: It’s That Easy</h2>
<p>So, let’s make a slide. Instead of firing up LibreOffice Impress, though, I just open a text editor a create a Markdown (.md) file.</p>

<p>First, I add “frontmatter,” which tells the system how to handle the file:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
marp: true
---
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(You can do more with it than that, but we’ll keep it simple).</p>

<p>Next, I start adding slides:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
marp: true
---
# Slide Title

Slide Text
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>It’s that easy.</p>

<p>That sort of thing <a href="https://robertwgehl.org/presentations/testPresentation.html#3">looks like this</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s add another slide, this time with a list. Lists are handled in the Markdown way:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
marp: true
---
# Slide Title
Slide Text

---
# Slide with List
- List item 1
- List item 2
- List item 3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s an <a href="https://robertwgehl.org/presentations/testPresentation.html#4">example of what that looks like</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, people often use more than just text in slides. I can add images, as well. Marp uses a syntax like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>![command](imagefile.jpg)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where “command” handles stuff like size, whether the image is in the background, opacity or the like. So a three-slide presentation with an image might look like this:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
marp: true
---
# Slide Title
Slide Text

---
# Slide with List
- List item 1
- List item 2
- List item 3

---
![command](imagefile.jpg)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, as you’ll see, I prefer to do things with HTML, specifically the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;figure&gt;</code> semantic tag, and style with CSS.</p>

<h2 id="css-zen-presentations">CSS Zen Presentations</h2>
<p>I love CSS. It blew me away when I saw the <a href="https://csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a>, which was launched in 2003 to promote the full separation of content and presentation. I am no designer – don’t ask me to come up with color schemes! But I did take the CSS Zen Garden idea and apply it to <a href="https://www.robertwgehl.org">my website</a>, where you can choose your style if you view it on a laptop/tablet.</p>

<p>Add in <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>, which allows for variables, and CSS is a really powerful tool.</p>

<p>So when I learned Marp uses CSS – with some SASS-like aspects – to handle the design of slides, I knew I would like it.</p>

<p>Marp comes with some default themes, but I was keen to build my own. It turns out that all I had to do was write a CSS file and point the Marp command line to it via a terminal:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>marp -w --theme ./CSS/custom.scss testPresentation.md
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s a tip for those of you wanting to style via CSS: Marp uses the HTML semantic tag <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;section&gt;</code> for each slide. To customize the whole presentation, style <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;section&gt;</code>, rather than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;body&gt;</code>, and you’re good to go: the whole presentation will be formatted.</p>

<p>And what about specific slides? Marp uses an HTML-style comment you can add to Markdown: adding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;!-- _class: CLASSNAME --&gt;</code> to the start of the specific slide adds a class that can be targeted. For example, I use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;!-- _class: title --&gt;</code> on title slides. <a href="https://robertwgehl.org/presentations/testPresentation.html#1">Here’s how that looks</a>.</p>

<h2 id="avoiding-death-by-powerpoint-the-css-way">Avoiding Death by Powerpoint the CSS way</h2>

<p>When I present, I do my best to avoid <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwpi1Lm6dFo">death by Powerpoint</a>. I use a lot of slides with minimal objects on a dark background.</p>

<p>Of course, with CSS, backgrounds are fully under my control. And since Marp allows SASS-like variables, I could just set a global value for the background (as well as other elements) in my custom.scss file:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>:root {
  font-family: "Cantarell Light", sans-serif;
  --text-color: #999999;
  --bg-color: #000;
  --standard-margin: 10%;
  --shadow: 20px 10px 10px #121212;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here you’ll see I lazily set it to black. I will likely choose some other verydark color, but for now that will do. (And, if I want to change it, I just have to adjust that one value. That’s it!)</p>

<p>Avoiding Death by Powerpoint means I tend to use a lot of single images. Wth two little bits – some Markdown/HTML and some CSS – I can drop in images with formatting.</p>

<p>Here’s the example Markdown:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;!-- _class: one-column --&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/stage.jpg" alt="a picture of a theater stage"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A theater stage &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Notice I’ve moved away from the simpler <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">![command](image.jpg)</code> structure to an HTML5 semantic markup, complete with alt text and caption. It’s a bit more typing (or copypasting) but it will be worth it. Notice also the class, “one-column.”</p>

<p>Now here’s some corresponding CSS:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>section.one-column figure {
  float: left;
  width: 90%;
  margin-left:8%;
  margin-top: 4%;
}

img {
  width: 96%;
  float: left;
  z-index:-1;
}

figcaption {
  margin-top: -8%;
  font-size: 200%;
  width: 80%;
  line-height: 200%;
  float: left;
  text-align: center;
  background-color:var(--bg-color);
  opacity: .8;
  z-index:1;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The result can <a href="https://robertwgehl.org/presentations/testPresentation.html#6">be seen here</a>. Here’s a screenshot, too:</p>

<p>Much like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxNYAe85L20">Kurt with his magazines</a>, with CSS I can make presentations do whatever I like. Including something that has eluded me in LibreOffice Impress for years: captions for images. That picture of the woods above includes a caption, styled with CSS.</p>

<p>CSS has a lot of power, and I’m only scratching the surface of what could be done. Once my CSS template is complete, all I have to do from here on out is edit Markdown files. This can work for academic presentations as well as for class lectures (which I often base off Markdown files edited in Zettlr.)</p>

<h2 id="dont-forget-about-html">Don’t forget about HTML</h2>

<p>In the above example, I link to a <a href="https://robertwgehl.org/presentations/testPresentation.html#6">specific slide in the presentation.</a>. I can link to any point of the presentation. On the web. In beautiful HTML, with alt text for images.</p>

<p>This is so cool!</p>

<p>All I have to do is run a terminal command with marp-cli:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>marp -w --theme ./CSS/custom.scss testPresentation.md
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Marp autogenerates an HTML file with CSS included. I move that to a server and boom! The presentation is online. This is so cool!</p>

<p>And I’ve taken a look – it looks very similar across devices. Responsive!</p>

<p>Now, instead of futzing with a LibreOffice .OPD file (or worse, so much worse, a .PPTX file), I can just post my presentations to the web and run them from there. It includes a presentation view, which shows notes that I put in the corresponding Markdown file within HTML comments.</p>

<p>Or, if I want to run it off my local machine, I can just present a local HTML file.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>

<p>I’m going to do it: I’m going all-on on Marp for a while. If things go poorly, I’ll update this blog accordingly. But right now, I suspect Marp is a future fixture of the FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream.</p>]]></content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="Goal 1" /><category term="FALD" /><category term="Marp" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[As avid readers of my blog know, I am livin’ the FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream: I use FOSS tools to do my academic work.

<p>ABSTRACT: “In recent years, we have witnessed increased interest in alternatives to the dominant corporate social media sites, such as Facebook, Twitter (now X), and TikTok. Tired of disinformation, harassment, privacy violations, and the general degradation of platforms, users and technologists have looked for non-corporate alternatives. Not-for-profit social media platforms emerging from free/libre and open-source software (FLOSS) communities based on non-centralized infrastructure have emerged as promising alternatives. For applied epistemology of the internet, these alternative social media platforms present an opportunity to study different ways of producing knowledge together online. This paper evaluates the epistemic potential for such alternative, non-corporate social media. I present an epistemological framework for analyzing the epistemic promises and perils of alternative social media. Then I apply this framework to the case of Mastodon, a federated, open-source microblogging platform. Mastodon’s structure and culture of openness present opportunities to avoid many of the epistemic perils of biased and untrustworthy large corporate platforms. However, Mastodon’s risks include techno-elitism, white ignorance, and isolated, epistemically toxic communities.”</p>

OPEN ACCESS</h2>

<p>ABSTRACT: “This paper attempts to build a case for adopting the model of the Fediverse to archive digital citizen-generated urban memory. Examining literature from several relevant fields of debate acts as a pragmatic foundation for reasoning to then outline potential core technical functionality for provision of such an archive, using the Mastodon app as an example. This ‘civic urban memory’ archive is considered as open, curated by citizens themselves and owned by them through civic public ownership in a context of technological sovereignty. Reflecting on issues of citizen self curated and moderated memory collection archives, and the potential for opt-in or anonymous archive posting may offer some mechanisms for fair and open curation, moderation and privacy protection in such archives. Conceptual backdrop for a civic urban memory archive is placed in current debates concerning civic technological platforms acting as a digital public good in a context of a techno-social contract for learning, with a co-constructed shared civic urban memory forming part of open incidental lifelong learning in a future learning city.”</p>

<p>ABSTRACT: “Introducción: Se analiza la presencia de periódicos en Mastodon, la plataforma social más popular del Fediverso y alternativa a X (Twitter) en este ecosistema de redes descentralizadas e interoperables. Metodología: De una muestra (n=38) de nativos digitales y matriciales de España se obtuvo una submuestra de periódicos (n=20) y cuentas (n=28) en Mastodon. Se identificaron cuentas oficiales y no oficiales, bots y no automatizadas, activas e inactivas, instancias en las que se alojan y accesos directos en los sitios web de los medios. También se identificó la fecha de creación de las cuentas para comprobar si aparecieron antes o después de la compra de Twitter por parte de Elon Musk, operación que disparó la popularidad de Mastodon. Resultados: Identificamos 13 cuentas oficiales (10 nativos y 3 matriciales), ninguna en instancias propias, y 15 cuentas no oficiales (9 matriciales y 6 nativos) conectadas por RSS por administradores de instancias de Mastodon. Los matriciales muestran mayor proporción de cuentas activas que los nativos digitales. La proporción de cuentas automatizadas es alta para ambas categorías. Se observa un “efecto Musk” en la creación de cuentas. Solo elDiario.es y El Salto (nativos digitales) ofrecen accesos en sus sitios web. El País (matricial) tiene la cuenta más antigua y El Salto es el que mayor compromiso muestra con esta red. Discusión: Los medios analizados no aprovechan todo el potencial de la soberanía tecnológica que proporciona Mastodon. Conclusiones: La plantilla usada y los resultados abren vías de investigación sobre una plataforma social (Mastodon) y un ecosistema (Fediverso) apenas explorados en el campo periodístico.”</p>

<p>My rough translation: this paper examines Spanish news organizations’ adooption of Mastodon, particularly after Musk’s purchase of Twitter/X. They find that most Spanish news organizations are present in the form of unofficial automated bots. They also find that “digital native” news organizations are the least likely to have embraced Mastodon. Overall, they find that news organizations are not taking advantage of the possibilities afforded by the fediverse.</p>]]></content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="ASM update" /><category term="alternative social media" /><category term="bibliography" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bluesky continues to blow up.

I didn’t plan this, but it turns out a lot of this is coming from <em><a href="https://www.404media.co">404 Media</a></em> – shout out to them! If you aren’t reading their articles… do it now!
<!-- more --></p>

<h2 id="the-bluesky-bump-continues">The Bluesky Bump continues</h2>
<p>The coverage of Bluesky’s growth is everywhere. I just watched my local CBC station present a story on it during the 6 PM news.</p>

<p>You can read lots of takes, but the one that caught my eye is <a href="https://www.404media.co/the-great-migration-to-bluesky-gives-me-hope-for-the-future-of-the-internet/">Jason Koebler’s article</a> in <em>404 Media</em>. He talks about the rapid growth of Bluesky, but also puts it in conversation with Mastodon – a system he had <a href="https://www.404media.co/mastodon-is-the-good-one/">previously been excited about</a>. While Bluesky is growing, Mastodon “feels” to Koebler to be more stagnant. His theory is that this is due to Meta’s Threads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Threads’s uneven entry into the Fediverse feels like it has made my personal feeds deader. My theory and fear is that Threads has allowed people to perform the act of federating by having their Threads posts go to the fediverse, but it does not allow people on Threads to respond to people on Mastodon. This gives people a permission structure to abandon their Mastodon accounts, use Threads, and sort of passively invest in the future of decentralized social media while actually just giving more power to Mark Zuckerberg’s side project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In contrast, he argues Bluesky feels vibrant and human.</p>

<p>Having watched the <a href="/2023/02/10/bumpAndSlump.html">“Killer Hype Cycle”</a> play out with Mastodon back in late 2022 and then seeing articles within a few months stating the fediverse had failed, I wonder at what point we will see articles with headlines such as “Remember Bluesky?”</p>

<p><em>Maybe</em> this time will be different. In some ways, it has to be – Bluesky has accepted venture capital, and that brings with it the expectations of growth and profit. Which makes it hard for me to consider Bluesky a Twitter alternative. It strikes me as yet another corporate social media platform – with all the downsides that brings with it.</p>

<h2 id="ai-and-social-engineering">AI and social engineering</h2>
<p>What downsides, you might ask? Well, speaking of <em>404 Media</em>, their podcast <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-ai-is-being-used-by-hackers-and-criminals-sponsored/id1703615331?i=1000677104448">just released an episode</a> featuring an interview with a cybersecurity expert Rachel Tobac on how generative AI is currently being integrated into social engineering. Tobac adeptly walks us through how deep fakes, voice cloning, and other AI tools are being used by scammers and computer hackers. For example, she discussed the case of a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/asia/deepfake-cfo-scam-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html">social engineering attack using deepfake Zoom corporate clones</a> resulting in a loss of $25 million USD.</p>

<p>I’ve been researching and writing about this with a colleague, Sean Lawson, for some years now (e.g., <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262543453/social-engineering/">our book</a> and <a href="https://theconversation.com/chatbots-can-be-used-to-create-manipulative-content-understanding-how-this-works-can-help-address-it-207187">this article</a>). While I was not <em>particularly</em> shocked by what Tobac talked about, I did not find it comforting to hear she thinks such AI-powered social engineering can only be stopped with stronger privacy regulations, particularly of tech companies and social media corporations. I say this because that’s exactly what Sean and I have been arguing, and it seems like my native country the USA won’t be engaging regulations any time soon.</p>

<p>Why not? Well, we’ve basically granted too much power to corporate social media and other big tech companies. Their lobbying power in the US was incredible before the recent presidential election, and it’s only going to be more powerful with Trump in office. The lack of privacy regulations forces US citizens into an opt-in setup where their personal data are ripe for the taking, fueling attention-grabbing <a href="https://www.404media.co/zuckerberg-the-ai-slop-will-continue-until-morale-improves/">AI slop</a> – and thus also tools easily adopted for targeted scams.</p>

<p>I should note there’s nothing in <a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/privacy-policy">Bluesky’s Privacy Policy</a> that leads me to believe Bluesky won’t partipate in similar data abuses if it means providing a return on investement to its backers. It’s also unclear to me that they are truly committed to moving the ATProto to the IETF – it’s been <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/protocol-roadmap">more than a year since they floated that goal</a>. A defacto corporate-controlled protocol – as open as it might be – is still a corporate-controlled protocol.</p>]]></content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="bluesky" /><category term="ASM update" /><category term="social engineering" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here’s what caught my eye (and ear) this week in the world of alternative social media.

Today. And switch to the fediverse.</p>

<p>Here’s why.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>When Elon Musk bought Twitter in 2022, rebranded it X, and converted it from the ostensible “public town square” into his own personal right-wing techbro platform, many many people left it for the fediverse.</p>

<p>But a key group did not: journalists. Sure, there was some flirtation with the fediverse, and to be fair, some journalists did make the switch. But many stayed on X, arguing that the audience and the movers and shakers were still there, in spite of Musk’s <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/elon-musk-twitter-misinformation-timeline-1235076786/">gutting of content moderation on the platform</a>.</p>

<p>OK, that’s an excuse to stay on X, journalists, but it’s increasingly a flimsy one. Especially today. What excuse do you have now? Now that we’ve seen how <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/elon-musk-turned-x-trump-echo-chamber-rcna174321">Musk made X into a machine to help propel Trump</a> back into the White House?</p>

<p>By legitimizing X, you’ve legitimized Musk’s insinuation into the halls of power – and you helped fund his efforts. You kept eyes on X, which put eyes on the ads. You kept people’s attention on the rage machine, on the disinformation and conspiracy theories. (And if the first Trump term is any guide, this is all going to get worse.) Enough already.</p>

<p>While you were sticking to X (and probably calling it “Twitter” out of nostalgia) millions of people were working away to make the fediverse a strongly moderated, calmer social media space where people do in fact discuss the news of the day and have <a href="https://medium.com/fedi-curious/lessons-on-the-road-to-reviving-journalism-via-the-fediverse-01b3748cacc5">welcomed journalists and news organizations</a>.</p>

<p>“But the fediverse is hard!” I can hear you protest. “And it would be too much work to have an X account and a fediverse account.”</p>

<p>To which I reply: what about Truth Social?</p>

<p>Since its launch in 2021, <a href="https://www.wbur.org/endlessthread/2024/11/01/truth-social">reporters have signed up for accounts</a> on Truth to access Trump’s ALL CAPS SCREEDS and dutifully post them in news sites in the name of balance. No doubt, journalists will be logging into Truth even more now, since it’s the main source for Trump’s thoughts. After all, <a href="https://theweek.com/donald-trump/1013599/trump-must-post-on-truth-social-before-posting-on-twitter-sec-filing-says">he must post there to keep the stock price inflated</a>.</p>

<p>Maybe I’m wrong, but I doubt reporters are using Truth to engage with audiences or to talk to their friends. They’re using other social media for that. Apparently, then, it’s not hard for reporters to have an account on Truth and still use other social media.</p>

<p>So, say it with me: <strong>X is now Truth Social.</strong> If you must keep an account there, dip into it to see what’s going on (you know, to watch as Trump’s attorney general announces the arrests of his political rivals) and then go back to your fediverse account. Just like you’ve been doing with Truth Social. You dip into Truth, copypaste Trump’s screeds, and get out.</p>

<p>Now, do that with X. Dip in, get out.</p>

<p>And put your energy into something that won’t be bought by a billionaire and converted to a fascism promotion machine.</p>

<h2 id="postscript-what-about-bluesky">Postscript: What about Bluesky?</h2>
<p>To be honest, I go back and forth on Bluesky. I know many people are enthused about Bluesky, particularly because they’re building their own protocol. But their recent <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/10-24-2024-series-a">acceptance of venture capital from cryptocurrency investors</a> begs the question: what will Bluesky do when the VC funders demand a return? As Cory Doctorow argues, it will <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/02/ulysses-pact/">likely be something shitty</a>. If you want to put your eggs into another corporate basket, go ahead.

<h2 id="on-fediblock">On #Fediblock</h2>

<p>One of the most used hashtags on the fediverse is <strong>#fediblock.</strong> Created by Marcia X and Ginger, that hashtag is essential for admins who want to learn about problematic accounts and instances. But the history of fediblock is not well-known. Now, Marcia X has <a href="https://subscriptions.boricua.style/fediblock-a-tiny-history-2/">written a short history</a> to help shed some light. We learn it came out of personal experience: “I started the tag so that bad actors doing quite obvious trolling or isms could just easily posted about to other people with whom I didn’t share a server with could see. Like a serial misogynistic harasser. There were no set rules put in place.”</p>

<h2 id="flatlining">Flatlining?</h2>

<p><a href="https://privacy.thenexus.today/flatness/">Jon Pincus argues</a> that <del>the ActivityPub fediverse</del> [edit: my mistake!] Mastodon is <strong>flatlining,</strong> particularly in relation to Bluesky. He puts the blame on the main Mastodon project, hoping that it changes for the better: “Whether or not there’s a hard fork, the same opportunities are there for the official Mastodon project if its direction and leadership structure evolves. The official project has some big advantages – including funding – so let’s hope that happens. And it’s not an either-or situation; forks don’t have to be hostile, and there are lots of potential synergies if they can work together effectively (as well as challenges).”</p>

<h2 id="but-just-say-no-to-bluesky">But Just Say ‘No’ to Bluesky</h2>

<p>And yet, <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/02/ulysses-pact/">Cory Doctorow notes</a> that he’s not going to ever use Bluesky. “I will never again devote my energies to building up an audience on a platform whose management can sever my relationship to that audience at will.”</p>]]></content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="ASM update" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[ASM updates are back!

<p>My presentation was “Fleeing Facebook and Exiting X: How activists show the path away from corporate social media.” Here’s the abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The purchase of Twitter by Elon Musk in 2022, coupled with Meta’s blocking of Canadian news sites, has prompted people in Canada to consider their social media options. Social media has now fragmented, with a small but growing population of people turning to non-corporate, alternative social media, such as Mastodon and the fediverse. This talk will discuss how non-corporate, alternative social media provide Canadians not just with a path away from Facebook or X, but also provide a new way to engage in online democracy.</p>

<h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>Before I get too far, I want to acknowledge a couple things. First, this research has been supported thanks in part to funding from the Canada First Research Excellence Fund.</p>

<p>Second, some of what I’m going to talk about comes from a collaboration between myself and Alex Martin, who is a PhD student here at York in the Science and Technology Studies program.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-news-and-social-media-in-canada">Introduction: News and Social Media in Canada</h2>

<p>Let’s start this conversation about social media in Regina, Saskatchewan. Specifically, let’s talk about what could be the top news company in Regina. It is, arguably, a garbage company.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.canadaland.com/podcast/1042-the-city-that-gets-its-news-from-a-dumpster-company/"><em>Canadaland</em></a>, the most trafficked news site for Regina
residents is a Facebook page run by Just Bins, a garbage can company. (I also should credit <em>Canadaland</em> another way – I kind of stole this intro from them!)</p>

<p>In fact, the Just Bins Facebook page won a “best of” award for news in Regina.</p>

<p>This isn’t to say there is no local paper. But the local paper, the <em>Regina Leader Post</em>, is seeing dramatic drops in circulation and no longer prints the paper locally.</p>

<p>That news reporting in Canada is in a crisis is not new, but it is certainly getting worse. Layoffs abound.</p>

<p>One major issue has been Meta. Because of the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/online-news.html">Online News Act</a>, Meta has now refused to let people link to Canadian news in Facebook and Instagram. This is in part what led to Just Bins Facebook page being able to become the top news site in Regina. As Jesse Brown of <em>Canadaland</em> said, “It appalls me that [Just Bins] can build a massive audience specifically because [it’s] not news. I can’t publish to Facebook, and [they] can <em>because</em> [it’s] not news.”</p>

<p>Regardless of how you feel about the Online News Act, it is coming from the recognition that a handful of media corporations have too much power over Canadian news. Let me put this a different way. Another, albeit different case in point: Elon Musk’s X. Unlike Meta, news organizations are certainly welcome on X. But at what price? As <a href="https://www.disinfo.eu/publications/disinformation-on-x/">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.isi.edu/news/55932/new-twitter-now-with-more-hate/">studies</a> and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/musk-lashes-out-at-advertisers-leaving-x-over-rise-in-hate-speech">news reports</a> are finding, disinformation, trolling, and harassment are on the rise on X. And often the disinformation and trolling comes from the top, such as when Musk labeled the CBC as <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cbc-twitter-label-69-government-funded-media-elon-musk-2023-4">“69% government funded”</a>.</p>

<h2 id="where-do-we-go">Where do we go?</h2>
<p>Meta and X have me wondering: Where do we go if we want to leave Facebook or X?</p>

<p>What about TikTok? LinkedIn? Reddit? Maybe. But all of these share in the same basic problem: they are all social media that is controlled by for-profit companies that, at the end of the day, make their money by monitoring our lives. They can be bought and sold.</p>

<p>I’ve been researching this question – where do we go? – for my entire academic career, from my days as a PhD student in the 2000s to the writing of my first book, <em><a href="https://tupress.temple.edu/books/reverse-engineering-social-media">Reverse Engineering Social Media</a></em> in 2014 to today, when I am finalizing my fourth book, <em>Move Slowly and Build Bridges</em>, for Oxford. (For more on my academic career, <a href="/2024/10/18/GMUpresentation.html">see this post</a>)</p>

<p>The answer to the “where do we go?” question has been given for many, many years by people I have been calling “critical reverse engineers.” These are activists who take apart corporate social media – Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X, YouTube – to make something better. I have interviewed dozens of these critical reverse engineers, studied the code and interfaces of the systems they’ve built, and have even operated some of the social media they’ve created.</p>

<p>It turns out that quite a few of these critical reverse engineers are right here in Canada.</p>

<p>Let me say a bit more about critical reverse engineering. And to do that, I should talk quickly about reverse engineering in general.</p>

<p>Basically, reverse engineering is forward engineering in reverse. Rather than starting with plans and them implementing them in material objects, reverse engineers start with the material object and seek to figure out how it works, often discovering clues about the creators’ intentions.</p>

<p>Reverse engineers do this work for a range of purposes. It might be to make a competing project – a famous example here is the reverse engineering of the IBM PC in the 1980s. Or it might be for military purposes, reverse engineering captured equipment – a famous case is that of the Russian Tu-4 bomber, which was a reverse engineered US B-29.</p>

<p>Now, these aren’t particularly critical. I’m using “critical” in the sense of critical theory – the examination of power in society, with the goal of making a more just and ethical society.</p>

<p>And I think that social media admits to critical inquiry. Social media has had a major impact on how we live our lives. We can talk about the benefits of social media. It has been used by social justice movements (Idle No More, Me Too, Black Lives Matter). There’s the simple pleasures of sharing and connection. And there’s local and global news sharing. And we can also talk about its harms: Facebook’s emotional contagion experiments. The Cambridge Analytica scandal. Gamergate harassment on Twitter. And concerns over mental health, particularly of teens.</p>

<p>There’s a lot at stake when we consider social media. So, let’s consider reverse engineering social media, but not just to make competing products. I am interested in activists who are reverse engineering social media to create systems that are better than the corporate versions – alternatives that are under our control, that push away some of the negative aspects of corporate social media away in favor of more beneficial aspects. I have been studying projects that produce new innovations in social media outside of the predominantly Silicon Valley model.</p>

<h2 id="the-fediverse-innovations-and-canada">The fediverse, innovations, and Canada</h2>

<p>Specifically, I will highlight the fediverse – social media that is comprised of thousands of small community-run social media sites linked together in a global network. As a project that critically reverse engineers corporate social media, the fediverse brings about many innovations.</p>

<p>I will talk about four such innovations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a new topology</li>
  <li>no surveillance capitalism</li>
  <li>ecological innovations</li>
  <li>online democracy</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-new-topology-noncentralized">A New Topology: Noncentralized</h2>

<p>I argue the fediverse provides a new way of doing social media, one that’s not centralized or concentrated.</p>

<p>I say new, but really what I’m going to say is quite similar to email. Email is federated. If I have an account on Protonmail, and a friend has an account on Gmail, and another runs their own server using Roundcube software, we can all still contact each other. We can do so in spite of the fact that all three are provided by different organizations in different locations.</p>

<p>This is because email runs on a shared, standardized protocol called Send Mail Transfer Protocol, or SMTP. SMTP dates back to the early 1980s.</p>

<p>Much more recently, critical reverse engineers have created a social media protocol that works much like email, but for social data. It works like this. Let’s say I’m using a system called PeerTube, which is a video-sharing service. I can connect to someone using Pixelfed, which is an image-sharing service. And that person can connect to someone on a Mastodon server, which is a Twitter-like system. And so on.</p>

<p>This is possible because of a new standard called <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a>, which, a bit like email, presents social data in the form of inboxes and outboxes. The ActivityPub protocol was authored by Christine Lemmer-Webber, Jessica Tallon, Erin Shepherd, Amy Guy, and Evan Prodromou. Here’s a Canadian connection! Evan Prodromou, who has been actively working on social media alternative since the late 2000s, is a Canadian. Thanks to Prodromou, Lemmer-Webber, and the rest of the creators of this protocol, we now have a global network of interconnected social media servers.</p>

<p>And, as a testament to their engineering feat, consider the fact that the ActivityPub-based fediverse was able to absorb a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2023/jan/08/elon-musk-drove-more-than-a-million-people-to-mastodon-but-many-arent-sticking-around">massive wave of new users happening in late 2022</a> – that is, right when Musk finalized his purchase of Twitter.</p>

<p>The upsides of this noncentralized system are twofold. For one, it’s less vulnerable to being simply taken over (e.g., as in the case of Twitter/X). Second, it is open to many groups participating in running their own social media.</p>

<h2 id="no-surveillance-capitalism">No Surveillance Capitalism</h2>

<p>As for the refusal to engage in surveillance capitalism, consider <a href="https://mstdn.ca/explore">Mstdn.ca</a>, a Mastodon server that provides Twitter-like features
to Canadians.</p>

<p>If you’re considering joining Mstdn.ca, you might notice that they ask for donations. Why? Well, they don’t sell advertising space. Unlike corporate social media, which is in the business of selling our attention to advertisers, Mstdn.ca does not sell user data. This is typical of the rest of the fediverse.</p>

<p>In my study of Mastodon and the rest of the fediverse, I’ve found that the vast majority of instances use donations or other mutual aid-style approaches to funding. They use a variety of nonprofit organizational structures, from informal to formal. And Mastodon and fediverse software do not include the tools needed to do targeted, surveillance-based advertising.</p>

<p>There are some possible upsides here. Since people cannot buy advertising space, there’s far less incentive to promote outrageous, attention-grabbing posts. Moreover, current disinformation practices rely in part on the ability to buy targeted advertisements – you can do that on Facebook and Youtube, but you cannot do that on the fediverse.</p>

<p>I should note I say “possible” because I think it is early to tell if these advantages will play out. However, in my interviews with fediverse users, they do report that they have a calmer experience on the fediverse. In addition, I am part of a group of researchers monitoring the fediverse for disinformation – a big concern as we head into a US presidential election – and so far, so good on that front.</p>

<h2 id="ecological-innovations">Ecological innovations</h2>

<p>On to ecological innovations. The brute fact is that, in spite of the promise that digital media will be light and airy, digital media is having a massive impact on the climate. Social media data centers – and the turn to generative AI – are <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/glep/article/24/2/9/120588/Generative-AI-and-Social-Media-May-Exacerbate-the">straining energy systems</a>. And data centers are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/04/25/data-centers-drought-water-use/">notorious for their demands for drinking water</a>. Speaking as someone who has lived in both the US and Canadian Rockies, this is a major concern of mine.</p>

<p>Let’s say people leave behind X and Facebook for the fediverse. Will the fediverse replicate these issues? Not necessarily. Because the fediverse is community-run, it is possible for groups to experiment with it to reduce its energy and water demands.</p>

<p>Consider the work of <a href="https://www.trentu.ca/culturalstudies/faculty-research/undergraduate-faculty/anne-pasek">Anne Pasek of Trent University</a>. Anne and her colleagues are developing solar-powered fediverse social media.</p>

<p>This isn’t far-fetched. A few years ago, an online publication called <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/">Low Tech Magazine</a> demonstrated that it is possible for a website to be powered by a small solar panel. Likewise, Pasek and her colleagues are working on powering a fediverse server with a small, consumer-grade solar panel.</p>

<p>This is experimental. Time will tell if it works. But if projects like Anne’s are successful, we could see a reduction in the carbon footprint of social media.</p>

<p>In addition, I can say that there are some clear ecological benefits to the fediverse when we compare it to corporate social media. I mentioned previously that the fediverse avoids surveillance capitalism. This does mean that, right out of the box, the fediverse should have less ecological impact than corporate social media, since it does not require the infrastructure of behavioral advertising.</p>

<h2 id="online-democracy">Online Democracy</h2>

<p>Finally, let’s talk online democracy. Here I’d point to <a href="https://cosocial.ca/explore">Cosocial.ca</a>. This is a social media site run by Canadian cooperative organization. As a collective, Cosocial members have developed their own, <a href="https://cosocial.ca/about">local moderation rules</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s a sampling of their code:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Treat all persons fairly and with respect, courtesy and dignity.</li>
  <li>Be sensitive to cultural and social differences and practices.</li>
  <li>Be careful in your use of language that may be disrespectful or demeaning.”</li>
  <li>They also have prohibitions against racism, transphobia, and violence.</li>
</ul>

<p>This can work because Cosocial is not large – it has 100 active members. It’s much easier to have such a code of conduct for a small number of folks.</p>

<p>So, you might think: 100 people? That’s not a lot. That’s nothing compared to corporate social media!</p>

<p>But Cosocial isn’t alone. Cosocial can connect to another Canadian instance, <a href="https://ottawa.place/about">Ottawa.place</a>. Like Cosocial, Ottawa.place has a code of conduct with similar values. So those two can connect without clashing about their ethical values.</p>

<p>And Cosocial and Ottawa.place can connect to another instance, <a href="https://scholar.social/about">Scholar.social</a>. Scholar.social is a well-moderated, large instance run by a person in Montreal. Like the others, Scholar.social has a similar code of conduct. And all these servers can connect to others in Canada.</p>

<p>But this isn’t just in Canada. These servers can connect others located around the world, forming a global network. And if they connect to other servers with similar codes of conduct, we see an emergent set of ethical values. This network of servers share a commitment to active moderation, not only against racism or transphobia, but also against disinformation. Studies are showing that there is a shared set of ethical values across much of the fediverse. I think this is most exciting aspect.</p>

<p>This is a structure a co-author and I call “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2022.2147400">the covenantal fediverse</a>”: a global network of ethically-aligned digital communities.</p>

<p>Here, we get the benefits of locally-run and moderated systems, but with the reach of a global network.</p>

<h2 id="but-what-about-news-in-canada">But What About News in Canada?</h2>

<p>But what about news? I started out with a note about the sorry state     of news in Canada – including a discussion about social media’s role in news sharing. Can Canadians share and receive news on federated, non-corporate social media?</p>

<p>This is an area Alex Martin, a PhD student, is working on. The short answer is: yes, Canadians can share and are sharing news on the fediverse.</p>

<p>Alex has taken the lead in a research project where we interview Canadians who are running or using federated social media. A big question Alex is asking: are Canadians sharing news on the fediverse? And what sorts of news are they sharing?</p>

<p>We’re hearing Canadians across the country note that the fediverse has become a viable source of breaking news. This includes local happenings as well as global events. And we’re also discovering people and groups who recognize this and want to make local federated social media so that people can share news.</p>

<p>What about news organizations? This is emerging, too, albeit a bit slower. <a href="https://mstdn.ca/@thetyee">The Tyee</a>, <a href="https://flipboard.com/@ConversationCA">Conversation Canada</a>, <a href="https://mstdn.ca/@thenarwhal">The Narwhal</a>, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@livewirecalgary">Livewire Calgary</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/@marilync/canadian-journalism-on-mastodon-15eeb4f5b9df">a host of journalists</a> are posting to the fediverse.</p>

<p>I think there really ought to be more. In addition, both <a href="https://theconversation.com/canadas-public-broadcaster-should-use-mastodon-to-provide-a-social-media-service-194116">Fen McKelvey of Concordia University and I</a> have argued the CBC should set up their own presence on the fediverse. They could establish a server and provide their journalists with accounts. Those journalists could post to the network and have global reach while at the same time being on a server run under CBC standards – not under the standards of Elon Musk.</p>

<p>Were the CBC to start their own fediverse server, they wouldn’t be alone. Globally, there are public news organizations starting to operate their own fediverse servers – most notably, the BBC has experimented with <a href="https://theconversation.com/canadas-public-broadcaster-should-use-mastodon-to-provide-a-social-media-service-194116">its own Mastodon server</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The fediverse has a great deal of potential for Canadian social media:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Canadians are, right now, running their own social media
        outside of the dominant Silicon Valley systems.</li>
  <li>They can moderate and govern themselves locally, and yet
        have access not only to the rest of Canada but the rest of
        the world</li>
  <li>They can experiment with solutions to the climate crisis</li>
  <li>They can stave off the privacy violations of surveillance
        capitalism</li>
  <li>And they can share both local and global news</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, Canadians are doing the work of critically reverse engineering social media, and are showing folks a            possible path away from X or Facebook.</p>

<p>This isn’t to say that the fediverse is a flawless system. I present plenty of criticisms of it in my book. But given the growing set of problems posed not just in Canada, but globally, but corporate social media, I believe serious scholarship that highlights the fediverse and critical reverse engineering is needed.</p>

<p>Incidentally, if you’re Canadian and want to try the fediverse, here are a couple options to look at. <a href="https://mstdn.ca/auth/sign_up">Mstdn.ca is open for registrations</a>. Or, if you want a more regional/localized instance, the <a href="https://mastodonserver.ca/">Mastodon Server
