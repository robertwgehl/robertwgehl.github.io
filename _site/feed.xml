&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this longer blog post, I wanted to give more context for what I’m saying, especially because the Pew report is pretty good work, with the definitional exception. Here I want to explain a bit about &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; Pew researchers can say “alternative social media” and only refer to exerable sites like Gab and Parler.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post will also be the skeleton for some upcoming talks I’m going to give, one at the Association of Internet Researchers and another at Malmö University.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.routledge.com/Right-Wing-Alternative-Media/Holt/p/book/9781032338200&quot;&gt;Right-Wing Alternative Media&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; Kristoffer Holt argues that scholarship on alternative media has largely ignored right-wing alternatives. This is because scholars tend to draw on critical theory (particularly Gramscian hegemony theory) and then go on to seek out resistance to mainstream media and ideas. This explains the emphasis on alternative media practices, such as those associated with the Zapatistas, the anti-globalization movement and Indymedia, and later the media practices of Occupy Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, however, the situation is flipped on its head. Currently, scholarship focusing on a new form of alternative media – alternative social media – overly emphasize right-wing platforms. For example, the Pew Research center just released a report, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2022/10/06/the-role-of-alternative-social-media-in-the-news-and-information-environment/&quot;&gt;“The Role of Alternative Social Media in the News and Information Environment.”&lt;/a&gt; Its somewhat generic name covers up a great deal of specificity: when the authors say “the news and information environment,” they are specifically referring to American media. More importantly (at least to me!), when they say “alternative social media,” they are referring only to specific sites: BitChute, Gab, Gettr, Parler, Rumble, Telegram and Truth Social.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know anything about these sites, you know that they are dominated by far-right users. Gab, for example, is rife with racist, transmisic content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it’s a notable example, the Pew Report isn’t the only example of scholarship reducing “alternative social media” to what ought to be called (following Holt’s work)  “right-wing alternative social media.” I’ve seen multiple academic papers making the same move. In fact, I’m increasingly exasperated to find that “alternative social media” increasingly &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; means right-wing social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter? Especially when most everyone is not using “alternative social media” – there are far, far more people on what I call “corporate social media,” such as Facebook and Twitter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It matters because this focus on right-wing platforms as the only alternative creates a very false dichotomy. On the one hand, we have corporate social media, which (in comparison to the right-wing ASM) are moderated. On the other, we have right-wing, alternative social media, which are either unmoderated (in the case of Gab) or simply attract and tolerate fascists or fascist-adjacent members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This false dichotomy completely misses a major innovation in alternative social media: ethical, moderated, noncentralized, and democratically-controlled alternative social media. For clarity’s sake, I’ll adopt a term from Clemencia Rodríguez and call these “Citizens’ Social Media.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-this-happens&quot;&gt;Why this happens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I talk about Citizens’ Social Media, let me explain how I think “alternative social media” has come to mean only right-wing social media. I see three reasons for this: the alt-right, the fact that right-wing alternative social media are easy for journalists and researchers to understand, and poor moderation by corporate social media sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-alt-right&quot;&gt;The Alt-Right&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One big reason, in my view, is the rise of the Alt-Right. The name alone gives us a clue. While there’s debate about what the Alt-Right is, based on my observations (and with the caveat that I am largely speaking of the American context), I would suggest the Alt-Right is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wwnorton.com/books/9781631495731&quot;&gt;White Christian Nationalist&lt;/a&gt; political grouping that is opposed both to the contemporary Left as well as both the neoliberal and neoconservative Right which has been dominant for the past 40 years. The Alt-Right is racist, misogynist, antisemitic, Islamophobic, and transphobic, drawing on these bigotries to oppose any political economic programs that do not benefit cisgender, Christian white men. That much is true of the Right in general, but the Alt-Right is also opposed to the libertarianism of the neoliberals: rather than calling for small government, the Alt-Right seeks to expand the power of the state to regulate sexuality, religious, and racial hierarchies. The Alt-Right is also opposed to neoconservatism in the sense that it is against global capitalism (and the attendant warmongering that transnational capitalism requires) in favor of isolationism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an alternative to the neoliberal/neocon Right, the Alt-Right needs to develop its own discourse and media system. Hence the rise of sites like Gab and Truth Social. Following the lead of political figures like Donald Trump, Ron Desantis, and Marjorie Taylor Green – and with a heavy dose of TV journalism from FOX News and OAN, these sites have helped Alt-Righters develop their disinformation narratives about the democratic process in America (e.g., “Stop the Steal” and the lie about 2020) as well as efforts to reduce the damage of COVID-19 (e.g., the vaccine is full of nanobots made by Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci at the behest of the Chinese government).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is where Kristoffer Holt’s work on right-wing alternative media is valuable: with his work in mind, I’m quite confident we can call Gab et al “right-wing alternative social media.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;right-wing-alternative-social-media-are-easy-to-understand&quot;&gt;Right-wing alternative social media are easy to understand&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason why “alternative social media” has been reduced to right-wing social media is, in part, because right-wing social media &lt;em&gt;look like&lt;/em&gt; Facebook and Twitter. What I mean by this is that sites like Gab and Truth are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;centralized (they have a single domain, such as Gab.com),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;they feature singular, founding personalities (e.g., Trump and Truth Social, Andrew Torba and Gab),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;they are for-profit enterprises, exploiting the activities of their users through marketing, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we can do social things with them, such as posting media, liking, and following.
So, for researchers and journalists, these systems are only different – they are only “alternative” – in that they harbor right-wing racists and misogynists, the aforementioned alt-right. In all other respects, they are easy to understand (unlike Citizens’ Social Media, as I will describe below). That makes them easier to research and write about, especially when facing a deadline or bewildered peer reviewers. (I could tell you stories upon stories about dealing with peer reviewers that think Mastodon is the same as Reddit.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;poor-moderation-practices-in-corporate-social-media&quot;&gt;Poor moderation practices in corporate social media&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part and parcel of the rise of Alt-Right, right-wing alternative media is legitimate criticism of the big, corporate platforms, such as Meta/Facebook and Twitter. Due to their well-documented faults in content moderation due to their massive scale, anyone of us can fault them for uneven, incoherent, or confusing moderation practices. (I myself was locked out of Twitter for… reasons. I don’t know why).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when entire industries have grown around monetizing audience attention, deplatforming for any reason can harm the incomes of people. Influencers, sex workers, or provocateurs who build personal brands in corporate social media can see their brand values eroded instantly by a deplatforming or shadowbanning decision made by some algorithm or poorly-informed and overworked content moderator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, a big event here was the well-deserved (albeit much too late) banning of Donald Trump from Facebook and Twitter after January 6. That drove many people to sites like Gab, which had been promising to protect free speech, or Trump’s latest grift, Truth Social, which doesn’t so much promise free speech as it promises to coddle Trumpers. These very, very notable deplatforming incidents lead &lt;a href=&quot;https://knightcolumbia.org/content/deplatforming-our-way-to-the-alt-tech-ecosystem&quot;&gt;Ethan Zuckerman and Chand Rajendra-Nicolucci to argue that deplatforming has lead to the “alt-tech” space&lt;/a&gt; – the sorts of social media. cloud hosting, payment systems, and the like that the alt-right is building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;im-not-saying-stop-studying-gab&quot;&gt;I’m not saying stop studying Gab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above leads to the totally understandable focus on right-wing alternative social media. Frankly, we &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; scholarship on these media, so I hope that no one sees my argument as “we need to stop talking about Gab.” No: study and report on Gab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just stop implying that it is the only alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;instead-im-saying-there-are-more-alternatives-citizens-social-media&quot;&gt;Instead, I’m saying there are more alternatives: Citizens’ Social Media&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we reduce “alternative social media” to “right-wing social media,” we end up with a vision of alternative that doesn’t strike me as all that alternative. We end up with a vision that is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;of centralized, for-profit services that&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;monetize audience behavior through selling data to advertisers and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;encourage similar growth logics among their users, as well as&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;foster white supremacists and fascists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we that far from Facebook here? Following Holt, if we need nuance in talking about “alternative media” in order to distinguish right-wing from other forms, we also need such nuance in speaking of other types of alternative social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where I am inspired by Clemencia Rodriguez’s concept of “citizens’ media” – media that are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;democratically controlled,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;liberatory and just,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;decentralized (or, as she puts it, “power is fragmented”)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;raise the consciousness and critical abilities of their producers and audiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote about such social media in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2056305115604338&quot;&gt;Social Media + Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; back in 2015. There, I made the same/opposite mistake Pew made: I called such social media “alternative social media” without accounting for the right-wing alternatives that were starting to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m working hard to correct that mistake by thinking about Citizens’ Social Media. I have more to do here, but I can say that such social media do exist and have actively opposed right-wing social media. I see this in many sites on the fediverse. They are well-moderated, relying on community decision-making to foster safety and debate. They do not rely on surveillance capitalism. They are more transparent at both social and technical levels. And while each instance is small, they can band together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem the fediverse faces is, after 2 decades of “social media” meaning centralized, for-profit organizations headed by personalities (e.g., Zuckerberg), networks of small, federated social media that are not-for-profit is just too hard to explain or understand. Social media that looks just like Twitter and has a bunch of right-wing goons, however, is easy to understand and is easily labeled “alternative.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we now find ourselves in the opposite space Holt discusses: we need scholarship that nuances “alternative” by focusing on Left alternatives: Citizens’ social media. In fact, this is what my current book project – Goal 2 of this blog – is all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="alternative social media" /><category term="Goal 2" /><summary type="html">NB: I just published a piece in_ The Conversation _about a recent Pew Research report, “The Role of Alternative Social Media in the News and Information Environment”.

But unfortunately, it’s a deeply problematic one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobre et al’s “More of the Same? A Study of Images Shared on Mastodon’s Federated Timeline” is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-19097-1_11&quot;&gt;paper that is now published&lt;/a&gt; in proceedings from &lt;em&gt;International Conference on Social Informatics.&lt;/em&gt; (Unfortunately, it’s not open access.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I’m currently researching the fediverse and blogging about that process, I thought I’d write up notes on this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why this paper? Frankly, because I’m pretty certain it violates the community norms, as well as terms of service, of many Mastodon instances. It instantly reminded me of the controversial paper from Zignani et al, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/3262/3130&quot;&gt;“Mastodon Content Warnings: Inappropriate Contents on a Microblogging Platform”&lt;/a&gt;, which resulted in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sunclipse.org/wp-content/downloads/2020/01/open-letter.html&quot;&gt;scathing open letter&lt;/a&gt; and the retraction of a dataset from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/R1HKVS&quot;&gt;Harvard Dataverse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobre et al’s “More of the Same” is a study of image-sharing. The authors claim that it is about image-sharing on Mastodon, but really their focus is on images they culled from Mastodon.social’s federated timeline. They pulled 4M posts from 103K active users, of which 1M had images. Since they pulled posts from Mastodon.social’s federated timeline, they saw posts from 4K separate instances. The authors state that a “relevant number” of the images they found are “explicit.” They categorize the images as such after running them through Google’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/vision&quot;&gt;Vision AI&lt;/a&gt; Safe Search system. They also run the images they find through Google’s image search to trace where the images came from and how they are shared on Mastodon. Ultimately, the authors don’t really make an argument, other than stating in passing that Mastodon needs better moderation, since people share explicit images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, “More of the Same” lives up to its title: it’s more of the same poor scholarship that can be seen in Zignani et al (in fact, Nobre et al cite that controversial paper). Here are my critiques:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;key-problems-in-more-of-the-same&quot;&gt;Key Problems in “More of the Same”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;violations-of-community-standards-and-privacy-policies&quot;&gt;Violations of Community Standards and Privacy Policies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the big one. There has been a longstanding community prohibition against taking Mastodon posts out of context. This is something I have observed again and again as I do my participant observation in the fediverse. While many Mastodon users might be ok with having their posts taken, many are not. And many instances prohibit the practice in their terms of service. I myself am very careful about getting explicit consent from anyone I want to quote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did the authors examine the privacy policies or terms of service for all – or even any – of the 4K instances they culled content from? There’s no indication that they did. Indeed, unlike Zignani et al, these authors don’t even discuss privacy. The assumption seems to be that these posts are “public” and are thus fair game. But as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aoir.org/reports/ethics3.pdf&quot;&gt;Association of Internet Researcher’s ethics guidelines&lt;/a&gt; have noted over the years, sometimes “public” doesn’t mean “public” – that is, it doesn’t mean “I want everyone in the world to see this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And most egregious is the fact that there is no human subjects/institutional review board information in the paper – it doesn’t even appear that the authors took that basic step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-consented-to-be-analyzed-by-google&quot;&gt;Who Consented to be Analyzed by Google?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s no indication that people consented to having their posts scraped, there’s &lt;strong&gt;definitely&lt;/strong&gt; no indication that they consented to have their posts submitted to Google. But the authors do exactly that – twice. They ran images through Google’s Vision AI and also through Google’s image search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many of the 4K instances seek to avoid being indexed by Google? I’m actually not sure, but I have seen people discuss using robots.txt and other means to avoid having “public” posts be indexed. Regardless, exporting content from Mastodon into Google’s indexes violates community norms, if not terms of service for many instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-explicit-and-in-what-context&quot;&gt;What is “explicit?” And in what context?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors run images through Google safe search and find that a “relevant number” of them “may be explicit” – that they might have nudity, or violence, or are spoof images. The assumption here is that Google is the arbitor of explicitness online. Maybe Google is, maybe it isn’t, but one key aspect is missing: context. Are they porn images? Are they medical images? What context are they embedded in? Much like the “public” aspect discussed above, I have observed over and over again Fediverse users saying that they don’t want their posts taken out of context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the authors note a number of the images are “spoof” images, per the Google analysis, and that spoof images are explicit. How so? Indeed, what does “spoof” even mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, none of this accounts for the fact that Mastodon (and other fediverse sites) use content warnings and other devices to allow users a bit of control over what they see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, the observation that there are explicit images led the authors to make a rather weak, in-passing argument “moderation is necessary in the Mastodon environment as images, while being a popular media format, indeed display a consistent level of explicit content” (page 189). But again, without context, these authors cannot really judge whether or not the “Mastodon environment” is moderated or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-top-ten-image-sharing-mastodon-instance-is-actually-a-pleroma-instance&quot;&gt;A top-ten image sharing Mastodon instance is actually a Pleroma instance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors don’t publish a list of all the 4K instances they scraped content from, but they do post the Top Ten image-sharing instances. Given that they scrape Mastodon.social’s federated timeline, it’s no surprise that that instance is #1. There are also other, unsurprising inclusions on the top ten: botsin.space (#2), mastodon.online (#6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a surprising #3, though: milker.cafe. The authors talk about milker.cafe at length, because they note that milker.cafe’s 11 active users contributed a whopping 26K images to the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is milker.cafe is a Pleroma instance, not a Mastodon one. Since they make claims about Mastodon not being moderated enough, this is a bit of a problem. I hadn’t heard of milker.cafe, so I took a look and got – surprise, surprise – eyeballs full of busty waifus… once I clicked through the “Adults Only” warnings. How many of Nobre et al’s “explicit” instances came from milker.cafe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And why didn’t the authors flag this Top Ten image sharing site as a Pleroma instance, not a Mastodon one? Could they not tell the difference?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-denominator-problem&quot;&gt;The Denominator Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the authors note that the largest instances share the most “explicit” images. This raises the denominator problem (as Eric Jardine might put it): they don’t offer any denominator, so we have no idea what percentage we’re dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a whole, the paper,&lt;/strong&gt; in my opinion, violates Mastodon community norms without really contributing much of anything to science. The authors’ key findings are a) people share images on Mastodon; that b) many of those images come from outside of Mastodon (e.g., Twitter, Reddit); and c) some of those images are – in the judgement of Google’s Safe Search algorithm – explicit. Therefore, they argue, Mastodon needs moderation. As I see it, the authors are relying on an age-old trick to get published: gin up a moral panic about some new digital media practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I  don’t think that these simplistic findings required such a breach of community norms and privacy policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-to-do&quot;&gt;What to do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is: beyond my critiquing this paper, what do we do? I mentioned this paper on scholar.social and people have floated the idea of another open letter, similar to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sunclipse.org/wp-content/downloads/2020/01/open-letter.html&quot;&gt;one sent about Zignani et al&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But would it be effective? I took a look at the previous open letter and note that many of the remedies requested haven’t been achieved. While Harvard’s Dataverse did pull the Zignani et al dataset, the paper itself remains published and unretracted. Unlike the case of Zignani et al, Nobre et al appear to have not posted their dataset anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Zignani et al, however, Nobre et al don’t mention privacy considerations. It could be that an open letter to their institutions (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais and Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto) &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; result in these institutions’ ethics boards to take a look at the work of Nobre et al. And since Nobre et al discuss future research plans involving media scraping from Mastodon, an open letter might prompt these researchers to do better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;addendum&quot;&gt;ADDENDUM&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fellow Mastodon member noted that &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/preferences/&quot;&gt;there is an option in Mastodon for users to avoid being indexed by search engines&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, I have it set on my account. So, for anyone whose posts were included in the Nobre et al study, they have been indexed by Google without their consent.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="Mastodon" /><category term="Research Ethics" /><summary type="html">There’s a new paper out about Mastodon!

Ultimately, the authors don’t really make an argument, other than stating in passing that Mastodon needs better moderation, since people share explicit images. In some ways, “More of the Same” lives up to its title: it’s more of the same poor scholarship that can be seen in Zignani et al (in fact, Nobre et al cite that controversial paper). Here are my critiques:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A Deep Dive into a Zotero Workflow</title><link href="https://fossacademic.tech/2022/10/05/deepdivezotero.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Deep Dive into a Zotero Workflow" /><published>2022-10-05T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2022-10-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://fossacademic.tech/2022/10/05/deepdivezotero</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://fossacademic.tech/2022/10/05/deepdivezotero.html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve previously posted about &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/12/01/Zotero-Tips-and-Tricks.html&quot;&gt;Zotero “tips and tricks,”&lt;/a&gt; I have a &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/04/02/ZoteroComments.html&quot;&gt;brief review of the beta version of Zotero’s PDF system&lt;/a&gt;, and I have an overview of &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/12/27/Workflow.html&quot;&gt;my workflow in Linux&lt;/a&gt;, but here I want to do a deep dive into how I conduct note-taking in Zotero. I imagine this can be part of a series where I talk about how Zotero notes flow into Zettlr and from there into drafting out ideas in Libreoffice Writer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, I will offer a two-for-one post: I’ll use my annotations of Derek Caelin’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-79072-1_8&quot;&gt;excellent book chapter on fediverse moderation&lt;/a&gt; as examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;colors&quot;&gt;Colors&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the most consistent thing I’ve done over my nearly 15 years (oof I’m old) of using Zotero is taking advantage of the highlighting color palette. Originally, this was limited to Zotero’s notes, but now is part of the PDF annotation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, Zotero offers a 5-color palette (yellow, red, green, blue, and purple). As I read a PDF in Zotero’s reader, I highlight passages according to this scheme:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yellow are good quotes or things to pay attention to.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Red is similar, except “hotter,” so to speak. If yellow means “this is important,” red means “this is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; important.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Green are definitions. When authors define their terms, it gets greened.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Purple are meta comments from the author about the paper. Things like, “In this article, I argue that…” and “Using a methdology of…”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/caelinQuote1.png&quot; alt=&quot;a screenshot of a note being taken in Zotero&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Excellent point! That&apos;s a quotable quote.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything I highlight in the Zotero PDF reader can be easily added to a corresponding note. These can also be sorted/highlighted in the Zotero PDF annotator, so it’s easy to spot Green (definitions) or Red (“hot” quotes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-about-blue&quot;&gt;What about Blue?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might notice Blue is missing. This is because I reserve that color for notes to myself. Whenever I take notes on someone’s work, I might put in a comment to myself, such as a connection to another article or an idea I have about how things fit together. Because of this, I don’t really use blue in the PDF, but I do use it in my own notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bluenote.png&quot; alt=&quot;a screenshot of a note being taken in Zotero&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;This is a blue note. No, not the cool jazz, but a connection I am drawing.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I do put in the PDF reader is comments on the highlighted portions. These eventually become Blue highlighted sections of the corresponding note. I also put these comments in brackets and italicize them, so it’s very clear these are my own musings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;tagging&quot;&gt;Tagging&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mention in the &lt;a href=&quot;2020/12/01/Zotero-Tips-and-Tricks.html&quot;&gt;Tips and Tricks&lt;/a&gt; post, I make extensive use of tagging. Zotero’s new PDF annotation system extends tagging into the PDF itself. Each of the highlighted portions can be tagged, and those tags are now searchable in the main Zotero window. This is awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, tags can also be selected in the PDF annotator. Also, quite awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/taggedAnnotation.png&quot; alt=&quot;a screenshot of a tag being selected in Zotero&apos;s PDF reader&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Selecting a tag means the corresponding annotation is selected.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;to-synthesis-and-beyond&quot;&gt;To Synthesis and Beyond&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might notice that all this work is based on a one-to-one, note-to-PDF system. And of course, writing is about synthesizing ideas from across many sources. A weakness of my system is synthesis – blue notes to self won’t cut it. However, I will address that step in another post – and it will focus on Zettlr.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="Goal 1" /><category term="Zotero" /><summary type="html">I’ve previously posted about Zotero “tips and tricks,” I have a brief review of the beta version of Zotero’s PDF system, and I have an overview of my workflow in Linux, but here I want to do a deep dive into how I conduct note-taking in Zotero.

&lt;p&gt;This is an open access academic article discussing Scuttlebutt, a social networking protocol that enables decentralized (and offline!) social media. The authors draw on three years of participant observation on Scuttlebutt: they use it, participate in its governance, and interview some of its users.

After all, are you invited to discuss Facebook policy with Zuckerberg? Or weigh in on how algorithms sort what you see on Twitter? In contrast, FOSS ASM allow members to not only do social things, but also participate in governance and coding. Mannell and Smith find that Scuttlebutt takes these processes further, actively &lt;em&gt;recruiting&lt;/em&gt; people to be in governance positions and recognizing non-coding work (like making user interface design decisions) through monetary contributions. Mannell and Smith use their insights to broaden the now-classic concept of “participatory culture” which was a very popular idea in the early aughts but was put by the wayside as the relatively open Web gave way to closed off, corporate-dominated social media.&lt;/p&gt;

To do that properly, I need to have a good understanding of ActivityPub, a key underlying protocol that enables servers to talk to one another. A member of one ActivityPub-enabled server, such as Mastodon, can connect with another on a different server – even if it runs different software, such as Pixelfed. It’s quite a technical achievement and – I believe – it really needs to be part of the conversation when we discuss things like moderation, platform governance, and the political economy of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to study how such software develops over time, so I’ve been going through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg&quot;&gt;meeting minutes of the W3C Social Web Working Group&lt;/a&gt;. It’s been fascinating to see how they, for example, discuss &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/Social_API/User_stories&quot;&gt;user stories&lt;/a&gt; and how they inform the protocol’s functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I posted a short note about doing this work on my home Mastodon instance, scholar.social, and people noticed! This is what I love about scholar.social – when I talk about geeking out about something, people jump in. Another fediverse member suggested I take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://yewtu.be/watch?v=c17gjxEoyMQ&quot;&gt;this week’s FOSS Find&lt;/a&gt;. And now, I’m writing up notes about it – at the request of the author of the Find. Read more after the jump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;benjamin-goering-on-activitypub-w3c-recommendation-2022&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://yewtu.be/watch?v=c17gjxEoyMQ&quot;&gt;Benjamin Goering on “ActivityPub W3C Recommendation.”&lt;/a&gt; 2022.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a recording of a presentation by Goering at “Papers We Love” earlier this year. Goering has been “working on decentralized social networking” for 15 years, and here the “paper” he’s lovin’ on is ActivityPub, a W3C standard. In these notes, I’ll include approximate minute markers, typically tied to the title of the slides. I’ll include summaries, and some of my own personal notes. This also includes some notes on Christine Lemmer-Webber’s comments during Q and A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goering’s agenda is to talk about ActivityStreams, the W3C Activity Streams 2.0, and then ActivityPub, past and future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;history-of-activity-streams&quot;&gt;History of Activity Streams&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.47 - “History (1997 and before) - Activity Theory”: He notes the connection between this protocol and sociology. The screen shows the book &lt;em&gt;The Russian Theory of Activity&lt;/em&gt; by Bedny and Meister, 1997. It’s about
human-computer interaction thinking from Russia. In the 1990s, Western researchers took these ideas up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.44 “I don’t know much about this,” he notes, but he likes the idea of sociology informing software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.47 - History (2005) - bengo blogging: He points to his blogging experience as a teen – the web wasn’t centralized. It was blogrolls, links, the “whole web was a social network” with RSS helping make connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.32 - History (2007) - Giant Global Graph aka ‘web 3.0’: Here we learn about Tim Berners-Lee’s work on the semantic web with the MIT decentralized group lab. The semantic idea is links between data within web documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.59 - History (2007) - https://diso-project.org: This is about the Distributed Social project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.25 - History (2007) - OpenSocial, OpenID 2.0: OpenSocial was a Google project. OpenID is still around. Goering implemented these on his blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8.12 - History (2008) - OpenSocial Foundation: This was a foundation started by Google, Yahoo! and MySpace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8.46 - History (2008) - activity-streams mailing list: he uses the Internet Archive to find some of the original posts to this list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8.50 - History (2009) - Facebook Activity Streams: “Facebook Open Stream API” - this would allow applications to read the Facebook Stream, and it would run on ActivityStreams 1.0. ActivityStreams 1.0 was a description of social activities in XML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9.36 - ~2010 - GNU Social, status.net, pump.io. Here we’re talking about projects like diaspora*, ActivityPump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~11.23 - an open social web: In 2009, he notes, Google, Facebook, MySpace, Microsoft, Yahoo all tried implementing open social networking “using a common data model.” “That’s no longer the case. What happened? How can we get back? Should we even?” This is a very important observation. What about the business model precluded such a movement? He posts a Quora article that discusses how Google and Facebook fought over OpenSocial – FB saw it as encroaching on its turf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12.13 - Embrace, extend, extinguish: He notes that this was a real possibility at this point. Think about if Google were to really build out a decentralized social standard and then either abandon it or make parts of it proprietary. The idea here is that someone like a Microsoft takes up open standards, extends them with proprietary extensions and gains market share, then extinguishes the standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13.01 - OpenSocial Foundation PR: He posts the 2014 announcement that OpenSocial Foundation (the one started by Google, Yahoo, and MySpace) “moved” to the W3C Social Working group I saw “moved” because the IRC meetings show they didn’t know this was happening and that it put no obligations on them; it just dumped the money on the WG, from what I can tell. He notes that they were donating their documents and code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-2-w3c-social-web-wg&quot;&gt;Part 2: W3C Social Web WG&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;14.24 - https://www.w3.org/2013/socialweb/social-wg-charter.html: He looks at the Charter for the Working Group. The Charter was meant to constrain and guide the group. He works through the Charter, talking about “user control of personal data,” federation, “embedded experiences”, and “enterprise social business.” The latter is about replacing email? Embedded experiences is about having social events trigger consumption “within the page itself.” Federation is what it implies – two or more organizations communicating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corporate actors were involved: IBM, Yammer, Salesfore was making Chatter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~15.50 goals based on the charter: make a Social Syntax (in JSON-LD). Make a Social API (client applications). Make a federation protocol, so the servers could talk to one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16.52 - Activity Streams 2.0 Core: ActivityPub depends on AS 2.0, but AS 2.0 is also independent. AS is about “social data syntax” (in the charter). ActivityPub fulfills federation mandate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2014 was a time when JSON was being used to describe things, Actor Verb Object. He talks through debate over JSON versus JSON-LD. The goal was to make it extensible, so JSON-LD is attractive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;19.43 - Activity Streams 2.0 Vocabulary: He walks us through Core types, Actor Types, Activity Types, and Object and Link Types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;21.42 - ActivityPub - https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/: ActivityPub makes use of ActivityStreams 2.0. HTTP helps send the AS data around (though he will go on to note that AP is not necessarily tied to HTTP). “Honestly, it works a lot like email,” he says: there are inbox, outbox terms. He wonders if they should have extended or modified SMTP [that’s a really intriguing little thought experiment!]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christine Lemmer-Webber, who is in attendance (and who also contributed a great deal to this project) confirms that it could be pushed past http, like IPFS, but that it relies heavily on the HTTP verbs GET and POST. Goering responds: ah, this is why there are so many verbs in the protocol – to make it as independent of HTTP as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;25.25 - ActivityPub Actors - https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/: Here we discuss Actors. The Actor Model from computer science. This is taken up in blockchain stuff, too. “Really, ActivityPub is trying to find a way to describe all these actors.” A stream of inputs and a stream of outputs between actors. The Actor Model in computer science goes back to 1973. [As an aside, tt strikes me as very individualistic – the actor speaks, a stream comes forth. Is there a way to model collective knowledge?]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;26.34 - ActivityPub Interactions - https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/: Section 5, Collections: servers maintain these – outbox, inbox, followers, liked, following. Section 6, Client-server interactions, how the client’s typing gets encoded in the syntax. Section 7, Server to server interactions: activities such as a follower activity means another server updates the follower collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;28.58 - ActivityPub “Security” [note: these quote marks in the original]: Security, he notes, is an afterthought after making the protocol. They wanted to publish the protocol and left security for the future. There’s a discussion of authentication schemes, signed keys. This was a bunch of suggestions, not “normative” (not required to abide by). He gets a question about authentication and identity, he notes that Oauth is the recommended approach but it’s an architecture, not a protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;32.19 - Social Web Protocols: This is another document that the WG produced. Amy Guy, University of Edinburgh edited it. This compares a bunch of protocols – this helped the group keep track of competing protocols. He notes that this is a good doc to study, so I put it in Zotero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;33.11 - relationship to Tim BL’s Solid: Starts in MIT with decentralized web group. Solid tried to leverage AS, AP. Solid gets lots of coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-3-activitypub-today&quot;&gt;Part 3: ActivityPub Today&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;34.25 - https://github.com/BasixKOR/awesome-activitypub: List of projects running on the protocol. Nextcloud social is one. Castling.club – chess over activitypub, he cites this as an example of emergent, unexpected results of a protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;35.53 - Mastodon wikipedia page: Mastodon was around before AP; they were using status.net, they were very early adopters of AP. He says he’s seen estimates that 10 million people are using Mastodon; he notes it could be much more. [I should ask him where he’s getting these numbers; everything I’ve seen estimates about 5mil users].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He points out Content Warnings as an innovation. Thus, he argues ActivityPub as a protocol helps set the base for these end-user features such as CWs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;37.58 - discussion of EU, Next Generation Internet: Billions of dollars to spread European values on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a server implements ActivityPub well, end users get a “lot of choice in how they participate in the network.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~40.00 - he talks about the term “fediverse.” He notes the fediverse may not necessarily all use the same protocol. The forum for activitypub is socialhub.activitypub.rocks – this defacto replaces the Social Web WG as an organizing site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;41.24 - ActivityPub Conf: He cites a talk “Architecture of Robust Kindness.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-4-future-of-activitypub-its-up-to-you&quot;&gt;Part 4: Future of ActivityPub (it’s up to you)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;42.13 - OcaPup: Object Capabilities + ActivityPub. Christine Lemmer-Webber working on this project to pursue security for marginalized groups. “OcapPub: Towards networks of consent” [I need to learn more about this!]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;43.40 - Extensions?: Discusses ways AP can be extended. This can be done via websites without permission from the WG; and if an extension catches on, it may be added to the AP itself. This is a benefit of JSON-LD; easily extended via RDF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;45.04 - Possible Futures: This includes non-http, e.g., Bluetooth, Data integrity, portable identity. Discussion of URNs versus URLs. Concerns about man-in-the-middle attacks that rewrite HTTP. Discussion of a protocol that would delegate the ability to post to others/other devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;50.22 - Related Work/Current Events: Slide presents Bluesky (blueskyweb.xyz), Solid, Spritely. Discusses Elon Musk, EU regulations. Due to the EU regulation, interoperability is much more important&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~52.00 - Start Using ActivityPub: Discussion of clients, Mastodon instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;q-and-a&quot;&gt;Q and A&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~56.00 - Christine Lemmer-Webber discusses the difference between the client-to-server part of AP and the server-to-server part. S2S is widely implemented; she notes that they were shocked that the C2S has not been well-implemented. Also notes they only barely got the federation part done. She explains C2S works like an email client: client to server, server to next server. She also notes that SMTP’s and ActivityPub’s “notions of trust” are “broken”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1:00.00 – Christine volunteers to clarify some things, noting Goering covered a lot of history she didn’t know. Christine was in Ostatus et al; Bengo was more familiar with Activity Streams. She notes Ostatus implementations often weren’t compatible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1:02 - ActivityPub: originally was requiring C2S and S2S implementation. These were divided later on. She talks about MediaGoblin, which promised federation. She hired Jessica Tallon to pursue it. They got involved in the W3C standards, and they were passionate contributors (they didn’t start that way) who got more and more involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not obvious ActivityPub was going to succeed. There were many competing protocols, none of which were talking to each other – and the common sense was that people weren’t going to get along.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="Goal 2" /><summary type="html">As I’ve written before, I’m working on a book about the fediverse. To do that properly, I need to have a good understanding of ActivityPub, a key underlying protocol that enables servers to talk to one another. A member of one ActivityPub-enabled server, such as Mastodon, can connect with another on a different server – even if it runs different software, such as Pixelfed. It’s quite a technical achievement and – I believe – it really needs to be part of the conversation when we discuss things like moderation, platform governance, and the political economy of the internet. I like to study how such software develops over time, so I’ve been going through the meeting minutes of the W3C Social Web Working Group. It’s been fascinating to see how they, for example, discuss user stories and how they inform the protocol’s functionality. I posted a short note about doing this work on my home Mastodon instance, scholar.social, and people noticed! This is what I love about scholar.social – when I talk about geeking out about something, people jump in. Another fediverse member suggested I take a look at this week’s FOSS Find. And now, I’m writing up notes about it – at the request of the author of the Find.

&lt;p&gt;As an endowed research chair, I have the privilege of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.regents.la.gov/assets/docs/2013/05/BoRSF_Endowed_Prof_Policy_Rev_10-12.pdf&quot;&gt;generous research funding&lt;/a&gt;. For the purposes of my book project, research includes talking to people, running my own digital infrastructure (e.g., the incredible Nextcloud), and, of course, studying texts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meaning of “texts” is quite open-ended. Obviously, I’m reading books and journal articles. But so, so much knowledge is being created on the Fediverse itself – including knowledge offered only to subscribers. There are artists, musicians, and writers using Patreon (or, maybe better, &lt;a href=&quot;https://liberapay.com/&quot;&gt;Liberapay&lt;/a&gt;) to share their work with subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Mash it
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much as I would subscribe to an important journal (say, &lt;em&gt;New Media &amp;amp; Society&lt;/em&gt;) to stay up on the field, I’m increasingly finding I need to subscribe to Fediverse-based artists, writers, and musicians. So, I’m going to spend a part of my research budget buying these research materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This raises some important questions, though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do I do with the materials I purchase?&lt;/strong&gt; The obvious answer is that I archive it. But since I’m buying these items with public money, should they be made public? I think the answer here is “no,” because the authors intend that these items be for subscribers only. The exception might be if the creator specifically and explicitly consents to have the item shared. In that case, I think my next step is to talk to a library to see if they want to archive the item for future researchers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, how might I cite these items?&lt;/strong&gt; The answer here is similar: I cannot, unless the creator explicitly says I can. (I’ll write more about this in a later post).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m &lt;a href=&quot;2022/04/17/InterviewWorkflow.html&quot;&gt;interviewing people&lt;/a&gt; as part of this project. How does subscribing affect my research prior to interviews?&lt;/strong&gt; Answer: I cannot really interview a creator without seeing their work, no? So, for example, if I want to interview an author of a book, I really ought to read that book, whether from a library or if I buy my own copy. The same is true of a Fediverse artist: I need to see their work to ask intelligent questions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, are the people you subscribe to obliged to talk to you?&lt;/strong&gt; This is the biggest ethical question I’m dealing with. My plan is to make it crystal clear that my subscribing to an artist does not oblige them to talk to me, and that if I reach out with an interview request, their response (including “oh, hell no!”) will not result in my stopping my subscription. I’m committing keeping my subscriptions going for at least a year, regardless of response to interview requests. (This would only change if my funding changes).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very least, then, subscribing as part of the research process would give me more insights into the creative works of Fediverse artists while supporting their work. I also do hope that subscribing can lead to meeting artists and creators who do want to talk to me about their experience with the Fediverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very open to comments and critiques of this – if you’ve got comments, find me on Mastodon (or comment below with your Fedi account, so long as your comment is set to Public).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="Goal 2" /><summary type="html">One major goal for my Goal 2 book project is to learn from people who create things on the fediverse.

(Goal 1, recall, is writing about being a FOSS academic. Goal 2 is writing a book about FOSS). My new book project will focus on what I’m calling &lt;a href=&quot;https://fossacademic.tech/2022/01/06/Goal2.html&quot;&gt;“ethical source alternative social media”&lt;/a&gt; – social media that allows ordinary people to be in control, that uses moderation for social, economic, and environmental justice and not to support oppression, and that runs on FOSS.&lt;/p&gt;

But I also want to use participant observation and interviewing. And, I want this to adhere to the highest ethical standands as well as use FOSS technologies throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to include the voices of ethical ASM members, developers, and admins. It may be tempting to do what a lot of people seem to have done and quote fediverse posts. However, I’ve observed that many, many fediverse users do not consent to having their posts taken out of context. There are public forums I can quote – for example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/discussions&quot;&gt;Github issues forum for Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;. But I think the best vehicle to hear people talk about their experience with ethical ASM is via interviewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1-participant-observation&quot;&gt;Step 1: Participant Observation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first step has been going on for a long time: I’m participating in ethical alternative social media (and quite a few systems I would not categorize as ethical). As I do so, I take notes on the discourses happening on these systems, and I try to figure out which participants are passionate and invested ones. I want to talk to developers, administrators, and members of ethical alternatives. I note who they are with the intention of inviting them to participate in interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-2-inviting-people-to-a-conversation&quot;&gt;Step 2: Inviting People to a Conversation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After coming up with a list of interesting people to speak to, I reach out to them. Most likely, this will be via a fediverse DM or email. This is the moment when I explain my purpose in talking to them and how their ideas can contribute not only to the book project, but also to magazine articles or academic journal articles. I can also ask them to look at an informed consent form – a vital part of ethical research practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I invite people to talk via whatever their preferred medium. If they have no preference or are comfortable with Jitsi video chat, I have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/jitsi&quot;&gt;Jitsi plugin for Nextcloud&lt;/a&gt; ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3-preparation&quot;&gt;Step 3: Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be ready for the interview, I should read/watch/interact with as much material from the interviewee as possible. I look at their public posts, blogs, artwork, videos, writings – just to get a sense of who they are and what they care about. Since so much of FOSS culture is pretty technical, I pay a great deal of attention to technical details so I am a bit more informed before we talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I write out about a dozen questions, ranging from asking for names/pseudonyms and pronouns to open-ended questions meant to spark a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-4-the-interview&quot;&gt;Step 4: The Interview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are using my Jitsi app, I can record the interview (assuming of course the interviewee consents not only to talking, but being recorded). While it will record video, I am more concerned about getting audio. Jitsi’s Nextcloud app has one flaw: it records to Dropbox. I am not a fan of this but I can’t work around it just yet. (If anyone has advice about how Jitsi recordings could be routed to Nextcloud, I’m very interested).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go through my questions, but in my experience conversations don’t always lend themselves to sticking to the script. That’s just fine – I use my questions as a general guide, but the discussion can go in other directions as the interviewee leads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I interview, I take notes on paper – after all, what if the recording fails? Paper notes also come in handy for the next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will conclude the interview by asking if the interviewee has questions about me or my project, other things to add, and if they can recommend other people for me to talk to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as the interview concludes, I remove the recorded file from Dropbox and store it on my Nextcloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-5-journaling&quot;&gt;Step 5: Journaling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the interview is over, I write a journal entry with my thoughts on the conversation – things like good stories, new ways of thinking about the topic, and a general summary of the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also happy to share my notes or the recordings with interviewees, so I follow-up via email to mention that and thank them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-6-transcribing&quot;&gt;Step 6: Transcribing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an area where I am tempted to use automated systems, but must refuse. After all, most transcription services, like Otter.ai, require me to upload audio to the cloud. No thank you. I think that violates confidentiality, and it also violates my desire to have this be as FOSS and self-hosted as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this is the stage where I either transcribe or at least take very detailed notes on the conversation. Full disclosure: I may start collaborating with a grad student; if so, they may get involved here at the transcription stage. But for now, it’s just me doing this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion-critical-reflection&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Critical Reflection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that’s that: the interview process. It’s almost entirely FOSS/self-hosted, with the exception of Jitsi recording to Dropbox. And I hope all of this is transparent and ethical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One practice I engage in throughout the above is: can this be better? For example, does my workflow adequately protect interviewee data? Am I doing a good job recruiting interviewees? Are my questions prompting a good conversation? And can I get away from Dropbox?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, what am I missing here?

It didn’t seem like a good topic for this FOSS-centric blog. When I did write about it, I focused on the fact that my co-author, Sean Lawson, and I were able to use FOSS (particularly Nextcloud) to write it. In the parlance of this blog, that’s a decidedly Goal 1 topic – about using FOSS tools to do academic work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’ve focused instead on my next project, the Goal 2 project of writing a book about FOSS alternative social media. My idea is to use this blog to publicly write that book. Such public writing is new to me – it’s even a bit intimidating – but seems appropriate for this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the more I’m digging into what it means to envision, make, and realize ethical, FOSS, alternative social media, the more I realize my latest book, &lt;em&gt;Social Engineering,&lt;/em&gt; is directly relevant to the project. So, this post is a way for me to make those connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book was prompted by the explosion of disinformation and manipulation we’ve observed over the past 10 years. The big events here, of course, were the Russian interference campaign and Cambridge Analytica, both reaching prominence during the 2016 US presidential election. (We also write about more recent events, but these are two very well-documented instances of attempts at mass manipulation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a better understanding of Russian disinformation or Cambridge Analytica “micro-targeting,” Sean and I turned to the concept of social engineering. We note that this term has been used in two distinct communicative contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First was the early 20th century propagandists who drew on the language of social reform and social science of their time. They proposed to adjust society using scientific techniques and mass persuasion, a process glossed as “engineering of consent” (to use Edward Bernays’s famous phrase).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, there were the mid-20th century phone phreaks and hackers, who use the term “social engineering” to describe their practice of conning people out of passwords. This is an interpersonal sort of manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We argue that both the mass social engineering of propaganda and the interpersonal social engineering of hacking merge in contemporary corporate social media in a form we call “masspersonal social engineering.” We define &lt;a href=&quot;https://watermark.silverchair.com/c000400_9780262368926.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAsIwggK-BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggKvMIICqwIBADCCAqQGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMYRnDz0chEg8p6ccQAgEQgIICdeFTnQWL17PMR9vfCgwJHJa9mUSadJGxEZGbQ55WiOpspJXi-nE2GHUh-JJvtcwSpeWi5QYTPZ_uSyH7QtFX9z06Dukk9NxStvdw6D7eBGHQdgbFtz0_FkXoEhvJRdsvVoJnwwwO-vu3fvRdkHWjlX-Qdr5bMlNH_HQJxKW7TOvFkXolVhz0w9XEnGvEcE5npx1KLzlFPiCmHero5cufwHKB7d8im_4Q7zpPvHrZSDtJB5i1zjleafXz_UL28vM9JhjHeEurgOf-raryGnepdJqxvvZqqrHraRWghk9T90beKO-BDCCiMKy9qCp100OSNf9BB9a_STvST0PcPdpoy12vP5ZSwXE-9QaxP6I8PguUwXRm9Gb-Bos8n4WtHqgJZIPPUyVXe4Pwzlr0s7SHFO7K7NG866vjfJ3tWefx4fkQBFxKAJMaIGq3VoULFl0cT12XVdkK0sxJt_xRRDDzUi-s0fhW1SBEjRNnAhe_EpdBpmDVUjJLU5V4TCv1Y9p7h0ubLKcyc8JwPjanaUmLvd-t5k0UqImqHiFbVu68fzSFqsehqPt56UrnknXlc6HqFjB10EHzmQgxk4cJR46uhohOpyyysIr3RxwNwx_Zs4uOqYZo-9zdvsMcCLVNLMXAU4mu3x1PDTY3z1ututpvDf-m3UkRmEngvqe1ve7v6cwE9MWJ-NaYQvrdJ53QzsZ5muuoiJTEAjYI8PptRclByNJj5UMQ3i7uYoC_wVDzYivtleynpi66aEN0_2GQsNawYCvEGeLGzTt4ZLudF18AUnfawOxhcpkWJxpaP9jTNIma5bbPqR3uea5SQFTWV_MfC43MPlrF&quot;&gt;this concept in the book as&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;an emerging form of manipulative communication enabled by
the unique affordances of the internet and social media platforms.
It brings together the respective tools and techniques of hackers
and propagandists, interpersonal and mass communication, in
an attempt to shape the perceptions and actions of audiences. To
manipulate, masspersonal social engineers gather data on their
targets; create fake personas to share messages; mix deception,
accuracy, and friendliness as they engage with targets; and penetrate
communication systems. Manipulation, in this case, can involve a
range of goals, which might include attempts to change actions and
beliefs. But it could also include discouraging action (e.g., voting)
and amplifying or intensifying preexisting beliefs (e.g., racism,
sexism, or other social divisions) when doing so is in the perceived
interests of the masspersonal social engineers or their clients.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The connection to my current project on ethical alternative social media is now very obvious to me. Part of what we have to do when making a better suite of social media technologies is to remove the technologies, policies, and practices that aid and abet masspersonal social engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are obvious things, such as eliminating behavioral advertising, which encourages the use of reductive consumer profiling and links those profiles to viral messaging – a perfect breeding ground for the spread of misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are also less obvious things that have to be done – such as bringing media control closer to the end users. I wonder how much disinformation and misinformation spread is aided by a lack of a sense of shared responsibility for the health of the “community” in corporate social media. Contrast this with smaller, federated social media systems, where users may feel that they have more ownership over the health of the instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this post is merely my flagging the fact that my old book may end up more important to the new one. I may refer to the ideas from &lt;em&gt;Social Engineering&lt;/em&gt; more often here. Rest assured, this is not in an attempt to sell my book, but is rather a way to think about how ethical alternatives may help alleviate the scourge of manipulative communication (or, and let’s be honest, how they also might become vectors for manipulation in their own right).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of that, if you’re curious about the connections between the history of manipulative communication and what alternative social media might do to undermine such manipulation, keep watching this blog, and perhaps you should check out &lt;em&gt;Social Engineering&lt;/em&gt; – it’s in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.powells.com/book/social-engineering-9780262543453&quot;&gt;finer bookstores now&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/5281/Social-EngineeringHow-Crowdmasters-Phreaks-Hackers&quot;&gt;you can get it for free from MIT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="Goal 2" /><category term="Goal 1" /><summary type="html">I’ve not written much about my most recent book, Social Engineering (MIT Press, 2022) on this blog. It didn’t seem like a good topic for this FOSS-centric blog. When I did write about it, I focused on the fact that my co-author, Sean Lawson, and I were able to use FOSS (particularly Nextcloud) to write it. In the parlance of this blog, that’s a decidedly Goal 1 topic – about using FOSS tools to do academic work. So, I’ve focused instead on my next project, the Goal 2 project of writing a book about FOSS alternative social media. My idea is to use this blog to publicly write that book. Such public writing is new to me – it’s even a bit intimidating – but seems appropriate for this topic. But the more I’m digging into what it means to envision, make, and realize ethical, FOSS, alternative social media, the more I realize my latest book, Social Engineering, is directly relevant to the project. So, this post is a way for me to make those connections.</summary></entry></feed>
