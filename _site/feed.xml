I’m hoping that my discussions of FOSS technologies in an academic setting help others – students, professors, university administrators – understand the benefits and values of FOSS in the academy. I’m not a developer, but I am a professor who’s been using FOSS to do his job for over a decade. I call this goal of exploring FOSS tools in the academy Goal 1. Second, this blog has Goal 2: writing a book about a FOSS topic. After some consideration, I decided to write a book about Mastodon and the fediverse. It should be out in 2025. Sometimes, the two topics will collide in a single post. My intent here is to be more open about my own research process and writing.</subtitle><entry><title type="html">The Plight of the Reviewer: Lessons from AI Generation and Software</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/08/06/reviewing-ai.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Plight of the Reviewer: Lessons from AI Generation and Software" /><published>2025-08-06T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-08-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/08/06/reviewing-ai</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/08/06/reviewing-ai.html"><![CDATA[<p>On the latest <a href="https://latenightlinux.com/late-night-linux-episode-345/"><em>Late Night Linux</em> podcast</a>, the gang discussed a <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/07/14/death-by-a-thousand-slops/">recent blog post by Daniel Stenberg</a> about the plight of reviewers – specifically, open source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_bounty_program">bug bounty</a> program reviewers, who are facing a rising tide of AI slop. I think this has implications for my profession, particularly the task of conducting academic peer reviews.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>As Stenberg reports, the bug bounty program had largely been a success over the years. He and his colleagues used it with <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a>, a popular command-line utility to transfer data across the internet. As a widely used, open source program, checking for bugs – especially security issues – is a vital part of maintenance. And as open source development has taught us, this is a task far better done by the crowd than by one person or even a handful of people. A bounty system, where people are paid for successfully finding flaws in curl, rewards folks for doing this necessary work.</p>

<p>But things have recently changed, reports Stenberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The general trend so far in 2025 has been way more AI slop than ever before (about 20% of all submissions) as we have averaged in about two security report submissions per week. In early July, about 5% of the submissions in 2025 had turned out to be genuine vulnerabilities. The valid-rate has decreased significantly compared to previous years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the advent of LLMs, people are now feeling empowered to prompt genAI with a bit of curl’s code, asking genAI to identify bugs, and then they submit the results as a new bug report, either hoping to help or simply hoping to win some bounty money.</p>

<p>This results in much wasted time. As Stenberg wrote in an earlier post, <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2024/01/02/the-i-in-llm-stands-for-intelligence/">“The I in LLM Stands for Intelligence”</a>, the problem of AI-generated bug reports is that they seem plausible, even if they’re bullshit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The better the crap, the longer time and the more energy we have to spend on the report until we close it. A crap report does not help the project at all. It instead takes away developer time and energy from something productive. Partly because security work is consider one of the most important areas so it tends to trump almost everything else.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A security report can take away a developer from fixing a really annoying bug. because a security issue is always more important than other bugs. If the report turned out to be crap, we did not improve security and we missed out time on fixing bugs or developing a new feature. Not to mention how it drains you on energy having to deal with rubbish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And such wasted time is a major issue with a volunteer-driven, open source project like curl.</p>

<h2 id="echoes-of-my-profession">Echoes of My Profession</h2>

<p>I find all this eerily similar to issues I brought up in <a href="/2025/05/08/ai-review.html">a recent post about academic peer review</a>, a practice I regularly engage in. In that post, I predict that having to conduct academic peer reviews of AI-generated articles is going to increase in the coming years.</p>

<p>Much like bug reports handled by open source projects, academic peer review is predominantly done by unpaid volunteers. Much like security reports, it’s a necessary part of the publication process (although I would grant the stakes are a bit lower). A successful bug bounty offers a reward (some cash money). Successful publication in a journal does, as well (most often in the form of prestige and sometimes tenure).</p>

<p>If I’m right that AI-generated articles are going to be an increasing problem for peer reviewers, Stenberg’s posts are sounding a clear warning: we academics will drown in AI slop, much as Stenberg and his colleagues are.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-bug-bounties-review-and-software-development">Beyond Bug Bounties: Review and Software Development</h2>

<p>Beyond bug bounties, software developers are also wrestling with having to review AI-generated code. On that episode of <em>Late Night Linux</em>, Félim Whiteley noted that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the problem of AI coding is the fact that there’s too much for me to review. It’s too easy to write software… I’m now overloaded with the amount of stuff I have to check and review and verify.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly, Jake Trent’s post <a href="https://jaketrent.com/post/reviewing-ai-generated-code/">“Reviewing AI-Generated Code”</a> considers the plight of software reviewers. He notes that AI-generated software code reduces trust during code reviews. To mitigate it, the reviewer must do a great deal more work than merely review:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s as if I as the [reviewer] have to start from the problem statement and reason through to a solution myself. The solution has to make contact with a human’s brain. I may have to reason about the problem, a design, an implementation, proper tests. This is because all that I can presume to have happened is the typing of a prompt into a chat box and the output of code from an LLM. I can’t just push that to prod.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Essentially, Trent is arguing that code reviews are reverting to the actual writing of code – conceptualizing a problem and implementing a solution. AI-generated code is making a vital stage in sofware development, the code review, much much harder – even as it makes writing draft code much easier. That compounds the problem – a glut of poorly-written code, generated by people who don’t understand it, being pushed on people who have to review it.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-for-academics-from-the-world-of-software">Lessons for Academics from the World of Software?</h2>
<p>So, bug bounty review and software review are being swamped by slop. I’m worried academics will be, too. Can we academics learn from the field of software development to mitigate this problem?</p>

<p>Maybe.</p>

<p>One solution on offer is to treat AI-generated code (or, I would presume, bug reports) as made by metaphorically junior coders. That’s <a href="https://medium.com/mr-dops/the-hidden-cost-of-genai-code-technical-debt-in-the-age-of-ai-assistance-d4b5be2d70de">the suggestion of Rajat Gupta</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here’s my playbook: treat AI like a brilliant but reckless intern. Review its work, enforce standards, and monitor metrics (duplicate code ratio, bug rates). Invest in training and lean on automation — linters, scanners, even AI-driven refactoring tools — to catch the mess early.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe that would work in the realm of software development. But that doesn’t quite work for academic peer review. I can’t treat every journal article as if it’s written by a student. Academic peer review isn’t a moment to train others – rather, it’s one of the first moments when academic research is tested outside of the bounds of where it was written. While peer reviewers do make suggestions for revision, our job is not to help authors completely rewrite their articles or re-do their research. We basically give the article a thumbs-up or thumbs-down, judging it on the quality of its methods and analysis.</p>

<p>There’s another solution on offer. Of course – of course!!! – people are suggesting that we just need to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidprosser/2025/05/07/worried-about-ai-generated-code-ask-ai-to-review-it/">use AI to review AI code</a>. And I am almost 100% certain many of my fellow peer reviewers will glom onto such a solution.</p>

<p>But I personally hate this idea. I hate the idea of offloading the intellectual task of reviewing to a machine, and I would hate to be on the receiving end of such a review. It strikes me as irresponsible and self-defeating.</p>

<p>Another solution to the problem of too much code/too many bug reports comes from Stenberg (he of the bug bounty posts), who suggests charging people money to submit bug reports, or removing the reward.</p>

<p>But he doesn’t really like those ideas. And I’m not sure they would translate to the academic realm. After all, journals are already charging money for the privilege of being published, and folks are paying. And there’s no removing the reward of publication – that’s essential to the academy.</p>

<p>Ultimately, looking through the bug bounty/software dev posts on this issue, I find myself most in agreement with Trent’s “Potential Helps”:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Write your own code.
Understand your own code.
If you use code from another source, give it a citation. For copy-pasted code, affix a URL to the source. Make notes on modifications. If you were assisted by a fellow developer, add them to the commit as a co-author or comment the fact. If you generated the code, comment it as generated.
If there’s a section that you’re less confident in, state the fact in your review request.
The citations of sources in the code help focus the reviewer to more granular portions for which more or less time and criticality might be warranted in order to mitigate the risk of the code, based on the source.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is similar to my suggestions in my recent post. I really don’t recommend any use of generative AI – after all, like Trent’s ideal coder, I would think my colleagues would write their own articles and understand their own articles instead of outsourcing any part of the process to <a href="https://blog.bgcarlisle.com/2025/05/16/a-plausible-scalable-and-slightly-wrong-black-box-why-large-language-models-are-a-fascist-technology-that-cannot-be-redeemed/">unaccountable and quite possibly fascist black boxes</a>.</p>

<p>But if folks are going to use generative AI in their academic research, I’d say the use of those systems needs to be cited. Clearly. Make notes on how you used genAI. Don’t hide it, even if you think it simply helped with grammar. Be transparent.</p>

For example, if I build a website, I now often use Markdown or CSV files to store the data for the site, process it with Python, and then push it to whatever server its hosted on. This time, however, I made something that certainly was a challenge for me: a bot to post random bits of <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/60528">my new book</a> to the fediverse.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="hard-stuff-made-easier-by-others">Hard Stuff Made Easier By Others</h2>
<p>I say this was challenging for me, and it was, but I think people with Python skills will see this as relatively easy.</p>

<p>I drew on the template provided by <a href="https://codeberg.org/stfn/mastodon-bot-template">stfn on Codeberg</a>. This approach is built for Mastodon and relies on the <a href="https://mastodonpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Mastodon.py project</a>, which itself provides a wrapper around the Mastodon API.</p>

<p>The first step is initialization, where I get an access token from my <a href="https://aoir.social/@rwg">Mastodon account</a> and add that to a .env file. (This is a secret key, so if you do this, as well, don’t share your key!). I used my AoIR.social account because I am reasonably confident this bot would not run afoul of our Code of Conduct. In fact, I’m one of the admins there, so I am pretty sure we’re cool with this sort of thing – but of course, some fediverse instances don’t allow bots, so be sure to check on that.</p>

<p>As for the Python code itself, stfn’s approach breaks things down into to Python scripts: main.py and services.py. The main.py script is the one to run to actually post to the Mastodon account and really doesn’t need much modification.</p>

<p>The services.py account, by contrast, needs quite a bit. Here’s my version:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import os

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see, I used Python’s CSV and Random modules. I took the raw text of my book and converted it into a .CSV file, where each paragraph becomes a row. The Python reads the CSV file. Then I took the random module to select a random paragraph. After that, I trimmed the quote back to 297 characters to the nearest period. That way the “toot” would stay within the character limit.</p>

<p>I added a Content Warning because, although my instance might be OK with bots, I wanted to make sure it was crystal clear to other fediverse folks that these posts are automatically generated.</p>

<p>Finally, I copied the scripts over to a Raspberry Pi server I run and set it to post every day at 9.00 am EST.</p>

<h2 id="stuff-i-wish-i-did-differently">Stuff I Wish I Did Differently</h2>

<p>The bot is working well, but I wish I had done a few things differently.</p>

<p>First, I should have simply randomly sorted the CSV rows and then had the bot post them in that random order. That’s because the bot has already posted a couple passages twice.</p>

<p>Second, I should have double-checked the paragraphs. There are a few block quotes in the book – lengthy quotes, typically from interviewees. When those get posted, it appears I’m claiming their words as my own. When that happens, I use Mastodon’s edit feature to fix it, and I add a reply comment specifying where the quote comes from.</p>

<p>Finally, sometimes the bot doesn’t run, and I suspect it’s because the quote plus content warning and link are all over the character limit. I should have built in some logging to see when this happens and fix it.</p>

<p>However, over all this has been a fun project – a way to share bits of my book with the fediverse while also learning a bit more about Python and Mastodon bots.</p>]]></content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="Goal 2" /><category term="publications" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[No one will accuse me of being a Python expert, but I have increasingly been using it to take care of tasks.

<p>This cover features artwork, “Untitled no 7,” from the <a href="https://artistmarciax.com/">artist Marcia X</a>. In addition to being an artist, Marcia is a key figure in the development of the <a href="https://subscribers.artistmarciax.com/fediblock-a-tiny-history-2/">#fediblock hashtag</a>, which is an essential tool for moderation on the fediverse. Marcia was one of the first folks to talk to me about the fediverse, right at the start of my planning of this book, and their insights into its history – including its troubling history for people of color and Black folks – had a massive impact on the shape of <em>Move Slowly</em>.</p>

<p>Oh, and Marcia is a DJ, as well. I’ve had writing sessions listening to her <a href="https://artistmarciax.com/dj-sets/">Afro-Caribbean techno jams</a>.</p>

<p>I selected “Untitled no 7” because I felt the kaleidoscopic image held connections and fragmentation – I hope it’s clear how this kind of tension is a key part of the book, as well as fediverse history. I see the fediverse as existing between individuals’ ability to link to each other and the ability for communities to sever connections, and often the decision to connect or defederate hinges on deeply-seated aspects of identity. Marcia and their experience figure heavily into a chapter that dives into that tension, so I was very happy she agreed to let Oxford use their art for the cover.</p>

Those people who really don’t like generative AI.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>My latest ponderings about the problems of generative AI center on academic publishing – specifically, performing service as a peer reviewer. By my count, over the past 15 years, I’ve reviewed 150 items – journal article submissions, conference papers, and book manuscripts. That’s an average of 10 a year.</p>

<p>Until recently, my biggest worry about this process was the fact that I am doing free labor that <a href="https://tidsskriftet.no/en/2020/08/kronikk/money-behind-academic-publishing">benefits highly profitable corporations</a>. To mitigate this, I’ve tried hard to do more peer reviews for genuinely nonprofit organizations, rather than the SAGEs and Taylor Francises of the world. But then again, I often do reviews for journals owned by those companies, so I am also very supportive of calls to <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(21\)02804-X/fulltext">pay for peer reviews</a>.</p>

<p>Now, however, I’m adding a new concern: that I’m not always reviewing the arguments, ideas, and thoughts of my fellow academics – some of the time I’m reviewing the outputs of machines.</p>

<h2 id="improving-the-methods-section-generated-by-chatgpt">Improving the Methods Section Generated by ChatGPT</h2>
<p>I’m talking of course of generative AI. ChatGPT, which has largely kicked of this craze, is already being used to generate text that is making it into academic journals. <em>Retraction Watch</em> <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/papers-and-peer-reviews-with-evidence-of-chatgpt-writing/">has found over 100 articles</a> with material obviously generated by that system. Alex Glynn’s tracker has <a href="https://www.academ-ai.info/">700+ suspected papers</a>.</p>

<p>That sounds like a lot. But David Crotty of <em>Scholarly Kitchen</em> <a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2024/03/20/the-latest-crisis-is-the-research-literature-overrun-with-chatgpt-and-llm-generated-articles/">is tamping down a bit on the panic</a>, doing some analysis in 2024 and finding that only a tiny percentage of articles have material generated by ChatGPT, and even those are <em>about</em> ChatGPT. (Indeed, <a href="https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110792270-007/html">I’ve written something that quotes ChatGPT purposely</a> to make a point about generative AI.) But even so, he concludes by stating, “there’s no room for complacency” in relation to generative AI language being published in academic journals, “and research integrity vigilance will only become more and more demanding.”</p>

<p>I agree. LLMs are a new phenomenon, and academic publishing is slow. I imagine that the number of submitted articles that include LLM-generated material will only increase. And it will be less obvious than the 100 clumsy examples <em>Retraction Watch</em> found – LLM-generated academic articles will be nearly indistiguishable from human-written papers.</p>

<p>That means peer reviewers like me will increasingly have to read, analyze, and comment upon computer-generated ideas. I might be asked to read a ChatGPT-generated methods section and critically consider if… what? If ChatGPT’s methods are sound? If the researchers’ methods are sound? Whose work am I analyzing?</p>

<p>I think that’s a major problem.</p>

<h2 id="existing-policies-sound-good-until-they-dont">Existing Policies Sound Good Until They Don’t</h2>
<p>It seems that publishers are thinking about this, and there are policies in place. But the problem I see is that the positions of publishers are contradictory.</p>

<p>Take for example <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/home/nms"><em>New Media &amp; Society</em></a> (NMS), a journal that has published my work and counts me as a member of the editorial board (which means I do a <em>ton</em> of reviews for them).</p>

<p>NMS is a member of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). COPE <a href="https://publicationethics.org/guidance/cope-position/authorship-and-ai-tools">has a policy on generative AI</a>. This <a href="https://publicationethics.org/guidance/cope-position/authorship-and-ai-tools">policy states</a> that authors</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>who use AI tools in the writing of a manuscript, production of images or graphical elements of the paper, or in the collection and analysis of data, must be transparent in disclosing in the Materials and Methods (or similar section) of the paper how the AI tool was used and which tool was used. Authors are fully responsible for the content of their manuscript, even those parts produced by an AI tool, and are thus liable for any breach of publication ethics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can get with this. If authors who use generative AI disclose what corporate entity’s tool they used and how they used it, I can make a decision about doing the work of reviewing the article.</p>

<p>However, <em>New Media &amp; Society</em> is published by SAGE. In its <a href="https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/artificial-intelligence-policy">policy on AI</a>, SAGE itself echoes COPE in stating</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The use of AI tools that can produce content such as generating references, text, images or any other form of content must be disclosed when used by authors or reviewers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It also says authors who use generative AI should</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>clearly indicate the use of language models in the manuscript, including which model was used and for what purpose. Please use the methods or acknowledgements section, as appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So far, so good.</p>

<p>But SAGE also carves out a space for “assistive AI,” stating,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>AI tools that make suggestions to improve or enhance your own work, such as tools to improve language, grammar or structure, are considered assistive AI tools and do not require disclosure by authors or reviewers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Man, that’s a <em>thin</em> line. So, authors don’t have to say they used generative AI to improve their language, but they do have to disclose if they used it for generating text? What’s the distinction here?</p>

<p>In fields like mine, <em>words matter.</em> Think of all the digital ink spilled about terms like “platforms” or “networks” or “influencers” or “surveillance.” Think of all the adjectives applied to them over the years – <em>generative, lateral, sharing, fast, micro, ubiquitous,</em> etc, etc. Then think of ways to define these terms, operationalize them as concepts to analyze social practices, and present one’s findings. It’s language all the way down. “Improve” (which is to say, “alter”) any bit of that with an assistive device and the meanings change – sometimes subtly, sometimes overtly, often profoundly.</p>

<p>So the “help with language but don’t generate text” distinction doesn’t really work for me. And this is not to mention “structure” – I read that and think about the overall organization and coherence of the article, which is actually an area many of my reviews end up addressing.</p>

<p>I would say that, if an author uses a generative AI tool, even for “language help,” I ought to know about it before I review. Disclose if you used generative AI for editing and grammar. Oh, and tell me what corporation’s product you’re using. I deserve to know.</p>

<h2 id="whom-am-i-reviewing-and-for-whom-am-i-working">Whom Am I Reviewing? And for Whom Am I Working?</h2>
<p>That’s my main point: I want to review the ideas of fellow humans, not the outputs of machines. Therefore, I need to know from journals and authors whether or not generative AI was used at <em>any</em> point in the process of writing the article. Then I can make a decision. Otherwise, I think it’s inevitable that I will be doing the work of improving the output of a machine rather than offering guidance and ideas to a fellow researcher. That cheapens the whole process.</p>

<p>And beyond the insult of having to improve the logic of machines instead of helping my academic peers, I also am concerned that my reviews – which take hours of work to write – will be fed into machines without my consent. This could be done by the authors, who want an LLM to help them figure out how to revise based on my review. I’m assuming any authors who use LLMs to write their articles would do this, so, again, I want to know.</p>

<p>Or it could be done by the press, which is interested in making a review machine.</p>

<p>On that last note, I can’t help but think that this explains the language/text distinction SAGE is proposing in their policy. It may well reflect a <a href="https://www.thebookseller.com/news/sage-confirms-it-is-in-talks-to-license-content-to-ai-firms">desire to sell the text of its publications to generative AI firms</a>. Their AI policy is quite celebratory:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Sage recognises the value of artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential to help authors in the research and writing process. Sage welcomes developments in this area to enhance opportunities for generating ideas, accelerating research discovery, synthesising, or analysing findings, polishing language, or structuring a submission.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No doubt these deals might result in “assistive technologies” that are marketed to authors, “tools” that can help improve a text but (so it is claimed) won’t do the thinking for the author, peer reviewer assistance, and so on.</p>

<p>There are already <a href="https://consensus.app">services that claim to use AI</a> to find sources and generate text. <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/ca/acrobat/using/ai-generated-summaries.html">Adobe offers</a> to generate a summary based on an article. Jenni.ai offers <a href="https://jenni.ai/">“AI autocomplete”</a> to “beat writer’s block.”</p>

<p>Again: where’s the line? At some point “assistance” becomes “generation.” Or rather, maybe everything becomes mere “assistance.”</p>

<p>And then peer reviewers like me have to review it.</p>

<h2 id="postscript-since-i-know-youre-thinking-it">Postscript, Since I Know You’re Thinking It</h2>

It’s important for context.</p>

<p>I conducted interviews as part of the research for <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/move-slowly-and-build-bridges-9780197776681"><em>Move Slowly and Build Bridges</em></a>. In my “Research Note,” I write:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I stored the interview data and notes on a self-hosted Nextcloud server, and I transcribed interviews myself. I did this to avoid storing data or passing interview audio through third-party cloud services, because I am quite certain few if any fediverse members consent to have their ideas supplied to train large language models, as is now happening to data stored in Google or Microsoft services. I realize that this book will be digitally scanned, and thus AI companies may be tempted to use it in their training data. For what it’s worth: I do not consent to have any portion of this book be used to train a large language model (LLM) or similar system. I do not believe any of my interviewees would consent to have their ideas used to train LLMs, either.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I worked very hard to maintain this position throughout the writing process. My notes were stored on self-hosted infrastructure (or, in the case of Zotero, in a non-public library). I drafted much of the document in Zettlr and LibreOffice on local files. I never ran anything through corporate cloud services. I was going to once again write a book without relying on corporate infrastructure.</p>

<p>But then I faced copyediting.</p>

<h2 id="the-copyediting-phase">The Copyediting Phase</h2>
<p>Copyediting a book is a major part of the process of writing one. After <em>years</em> of note-taking, drafting, writing, refining, responding to peer reviews, refining further, copyediting is the moment when someone other than the author – the copyeditor – goes through the manuscript line-by-line and corrects small errors, revises ackward sentences, and clarifies.</p>

<p>For <em>Move Slowly</em>, Oxford hired <a href="https://reedsy.com/leslie-anglin">Leslie Anglin</a>. Leslie did a superlative job. I’m really, really happy with the results – it’s my writing but improved and with far less errors. (Thank you, Leslie!)</p>

<p>Copyeditors of course need tools to do this work. Over the course of my four books, the tool I’ve seen copyeditors use again and again is, unsurprisingly, Microsoft Word. I get it – it’s ubiquitous.</p>

<p>Normally, if someone I’m working with uses Word, I have little trouble editing .DOCX files with LibreOffice. It’s not always perfect but it’s very, very workable.</p>

<p>But in the case of copyediting, copyeditors do some stuff with Word that I do not comprehend. Paragraphs, phrases, and even individual words get coded (with corresponding colors). Endnotes are handled in a specific manner. Author Queries, where the copyeditor asks the author about something to be fixed, are handled in special ways (even if they are based on standard document comments). There are track changes to consider. As savvy as I might be, copyeditors clearly have a whole other level of fluency with a word processor than me.</p>

<p>LibreOffice simply doesn’t handle the special formatting practices of copyeditors well. In the case of <em>Move Slowly,</em> I tried to review and respond to copyedits with LibreOffice Writer and it got mangled quickly. (At one point Writer was deleting words seemingly at random – not good!) As a result, as with all my prior books, I’ve had to find a way to deal Microsoft Word to complete the copyediting phase.</p>

<p>Over the years, this hasn’t been too big an issue. After all, Microsoft Word has been ubiquitous for years – I would just find a computer running it. I vividly remember sitting in a University of Utah lab during a 2014 weekend to engage with copyedits for my first book. I’ve repeated the process in computer labs at a variety of universities for the next few books.</p>

<h2 id="this-time-was-different">This Time Was Different</h2>
<p>But copyediting with Microsoft Word in 2025 is a very different matter than in 2014. Back then, Microsoft Word was installed on the computer. Now Word is a <em>service</em>. You basically need an account to use it. It’s in the cloud. And since 2023, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/microsoft-ai-copilot-office-suit-1.6780630">Microsoft began adding generative AI to Word</a>.</p>

<p>And that’s a problem. I pledged to avoid running my work through cloud services or through anything associated with an LLM. Finding a machine with a “local” Word installation is not a thing these days. Uploading my book to Word 365 would have broken my heart. I’ve made it <em>so far</em> without having done this sort of thing. Would I be forced to now?</p>

<h2 id="what-about-softmaker-office">What about Softmaker Office?</h2>
<p>Then it hit me: Softmaker Office.</p>

<p>I had used Softmaker Office in the past on occasions when I simply couldn’t work with Microsoft Office files in LibreOffice. Particularly in the case of Powerpoint files, which invariably get utterly mangled in LibreOffice Impress. I had purchased a copy of Softmaker in the past – maybe it would be the solution here. It isn’t FOSS - it is proprietary. But (at least in the past) it was local to my machine.</p>

<p>So I looked at <a href="https://www.softmaker.com/en/softmaker-office">Softmaker’s site</a> and <em>almost</em> paid for a new license. And then I saw it: <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/softmaker-office">Softmaker now includes ChatGPT</a>.</p>

<p>Maaaaaybe the use of ChatGPT is optional and I could avoid it? But I wasn’t willing to risk it.</p>

<p>It seems like we can’t escape from the AI mania.</p>

<h2 id="this-one-weird-trick">This One Weird Trick</h2>
<p>I was full on despair mode at this point.</p>

<p>Look, I know for a fact my book will be fed into generative AI. I have no illusions that the passage I quoted above will help. Here’s what we’ve already seen:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the time since I signed the contract with Oxfor UP and now, they have <a href="https://www.thebookseller.com/news/wiley-cambridge-university-press-and-oxford-university-press-confirm-ai-partnerships">entered into agreements</a> with generative AI companies. (I have not heard from the press about this, so I cannot say if my book will be included).</li>
  <li>Regardless, my book will likely be pirated, which means it will be out there with little in the way of restrictions. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/03/libgen-meta-openai/682093/">Meta has simply gone to pirate libraries to train LLaMA</a>. My previous work is included.</li>
  <li>And of course, during this copyediting process, surely someone at the press, or my copyeditor, moved my manuscript into a cloud service – it seems unlikely my book escaped being turned into an LLM input.</li>
</ul>

<p>But despite these facts I <em>do not want to simply give in.</em> I do not want to be forced to contribute directly to the generative AI machine.</p>

<p>It seemed that the copyediting phase would be my downfall – whether using Word or Softmaker Office, there would be a chance that my materials would feed some LLM.</p>

<p>Then, I remembered: I still have an old copy of Softmaker Office, one I bought in 2018. It’s stored on my machine as a .DEB package. Could I use that?</p>

<p>Turns out, I could. Thank you, Linux! I installed and ran that seven-year-old binary on a modern machine and it worked flawlessly. Softmaker’s compatibility with Word held up. I was able to do the copyediting queries successfully – the proof is in the proofs I just received from the press.</p>

<p>I suppose in the future I could even run this old version of Softmaker in a virtual machine and replicate this trick.</p>

<h2 id="copyediting-and-the-fald">Copyediting and the FALD</h2>
<p>Copyediting continues to be a major hurdle to the FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream. While I’ve written many papers with collaborators over the years, when it comes to the peculiarities of copyediting, I have been repeatedly compelled to throw my workflow out the window and adapt. In the past, this was a minor inconvenience – just use Word for a weekend!</p>

<p>But now? Now it means agreeing to have my work be the property of Microsoft’s cloud services. Companies like Microsoft are simply claiming more and more power over the things we make. And given everything going on – particularly in the USA – I don’t see that changing before I finish up my next book.</p>]]></content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="Goal 1" /><category term="Goal 2" /><category term="workflow" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m starting this post with a specific passage from my upcoming book.

<p>I am now wrapping up my latest book, <em>Move Slowly and Build Bridges</em>, which is a critical study of Mastodon and the fediverse. That book is the culmination of years of academic research. In this post, I will focus on how I wrote that book.</p>

<h2 id="linux">Linux</h2>
<p>I have not done anything productive with a Windows or Mac machine for… a very long time. Since 2013, probably? Anyway, <a href="/2024/05/24/fald.html">I use Linux</a>. These days I’m using <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/spins/kde">Fedora with KDE Plasma</a>, but by the time you read this I could be using something else. In any case, it’s the OS for the FALD.</p>

<h2 id="zotero">Zotero</h2>
<p>No surprises here. For me, since about 2008, it’s always begun with <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>. So much of my work requires documenting websites, blog posts, journal articles, and other digital artifacts, and Zotero makes that easy. It integrates with my web browser, <a href="https://librewolf.net/">LibreWolf</a> – which makes sense, because LibreWolf is based on Firefox.</p>

<p>Zotero also is essential for adding citations to documents. In terms of my latest book, it has made life very easy. Usually, copyeding book manuscripts involves <em>hours</em> of editing citations – adding missing page ranges, missing cities (for books), that sort of thing. Not this time. I think Zotero has improved in how it grabs metadata from the web. My copyeditor had very few author queries for citations in <em>Move Slowly</em>.</p>

<h2 id="zettlr">Zettlr</h2>
<p>For many years, Zotero was the only Z-software for me. (Zoom <em>definitely</em> does not count). But over the course of writing my latest book, <a href="https://www.zettlr.com/">Zettlr</a> elbowed its way into the workflow.</p>

<p>Previously, I would use Zotero to take notes on artifacts. I still do. But note-taking in Zotero isn’t very synthetic – it focuses on single artifacts. That’s great for taking detailed notes on a book or article, but not so good for working out thoughts based on several artifacts.</p>

<p>Zettlr fills that role very well. It’s Markdown-based, so I can just fire it up and start writing down thoughts. It supports #hashtags, so I replicate the tagging I do in Zotero to start linking ideas together.</p>

<h2 id="libreoffice-writer">LibreOffice Writer</h2>
<p>However, while Zettlr promises that you can go from notes to publishable documents, I’m not quite there with it yet. For writing up polished documents, I turn to <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice Writer</a>. It integrates extremely well with Zotero, so I use it to compose the drafts and final drafts of books and journal articles.</p>

<h2 id="nextcloud">Nextcloud</h2>
<p><a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a> is the Swiss Army knife of the FALD. I run my own Nextcloud server, and there’s <em>so much</em> I can do with it:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Nextcloud Talk</strong>: This video chat system was central to my <a href="/2022/04/17/InterviewWorkflow.html">interview-based research process</a>. Since I was interviewing people who build, run, and participate in federated social media, I did not want to use Zoom or Teams – we’ve already seen those systems invade people’s privacy and turn everything into AI. Nextcloud Talk is under my control and so I can ensure my interviewees that our conversations are private.</li>
  <li><strong>Nextcloud Appointments</strong>: I’ve <a href="/2021/09/25/Appointments.html">already written</a> about how great this system is. For scheduling interviews, I can just share a link to my Appointments page, they can pick a time that works for them (and doesn’t conflict with my Nextcloud calendar), and they automatically get a Nextcloud Talk link via email. It’s brilliant.</li>
  <li><strong>Sharing</strong>: Nextcloud makes sharing files – like informed consent documents or drafts – super easy. It also helps with collaborating with other authors.</li>
  <li><strong>Sync</strong>: Obviously, this is central. My files are ready to go on any of my computers, whether at home or at the office. In addition, if I’m away from either but able to get online, I can login to Nextcloud and edit Markdown files if I need to take notes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="marp">MARP</h2>
<p>Very often I need to present my work to audiences. For years I’d use LibreOffice Impress or – ugh! – Google Docs to make slides. Not now. <a href="/2024/12/07/marpbeautifulsoup.html">Now I use MARP</a>, which generates slides from Markdown files. I’ve written scripts that automate turning files I edit in Zettlr into slides and notes, and these can be easily shared online – with accessibility features like alt text!</p>

<h2 id="tuba">Tuba</h2>
<p>These days, you gotta promote your work. <a href="https://aoir.social/@rwg">I’m on the fediverse</a>, of course, and I traditionally have posted using Mastodon’s web interface. Lately, however, I’ve been using a desktop client called <a href="https://github.com/GeopJr/Tuba">Tuba</a> to post. It’s great – I can set it to “slow mode” where posts come in only when I refresh the interface, and it’s easy to switch between multiple accounts.</p>

<h2 id="jekyll-over-git">Jekyll over Git</h2>
<p>Finally, you’re reading this on a static <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> blog pushed to the web via Git. While I’ve had some issues with Jekyll, when it’s working, it’s very easy: just type out a Markdown file, push it via Git, and it’s online.</p>

<h2 id="back-it-up">Back It Up</h2>
<p>As the wisdom goes, if your files are in less than three different places, they’re nowhere. I use <a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a> to sync files across my network (which itself runs over a <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">Wireguard</a> VPN). I also pay for a <a href="https://www.borgbase.com/">Borg Base</a> account, using <a href="https://vorta.borgbase.com/">Vorta</a> to encrypt and back up my files.</p>

<h2 id="foss-academic-lifestyle-dream-still-in-effect">FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream Still In Effect</h2>
<p>It’s 2025. A lot of stuff is going wrong. But while tech oligarchs seek to run our lives, there are paths of escape. You don’t have to replicate my entire workflow. But if you want to explore escape routes from Microsoft, X, Apple, or Google, try one of the above. Try out Zotero, or maybe take a chance on running a Nextcloud server. Maybe try using LibreOffice instead of Google Docs or Microsoft Office.</p>

<p>Take a step in the direction of the FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream.

It is hard for me not to see this as another aspect of a potential “standards war” between ActivityPub and ATProto.</p>

<h2 id="whats-iftas">What’s IFTAS?</h2>

<p>What is (or was) IFTAS? IFTAS is the Independent Federated Trust and Safety organization,* a non-profit that was inspired by the 2022/2023 influx of people into the fediverse after Elon Musk purchased Twitter. As they wrote in an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230816114557/https://about.iftas.org/2023/08/09/iftas-federated-trust-and-safety/">introductory blog post</a>, “More and more people were joining [Mastodon and the fediverse], and more and more people were wondering ‘if this keeps growing, how does moderation scale?’”</p>

<p>IFTAS’s founder, <a href="https://jaz.co.uk/">Jaz-Michael King</a>, successfully raised initial funds to bring the organization online. The organization ran fediverse moderator needs surveys and later developed a space for moderators to share knowledge (IFTAS Connect) as well as various blocklists that fediverse admins could import.</p>

<p>Full disclosure: <a href="https://about.iftas.org/first-50/">I gave money to IFTAS</a>. I also asked the Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR) to <a href="https://about.iftas.org/our-supporters/">give money to IFTAS</a>, since AoIR’s <a href="https://aoir.social">Mastodon server</a> has benefited from ITFAS’s services.</p>

<p>I know AoIR.social has benefited because I’m one of AoIR.social’s admins, and thus I do a lot of content moderation on that server. While we did not really use IFTAS’s blocklists specifically, we certainly have <a href="/2023/09/20/blocklists.html">benefited from the use of blocklists</a> in general. We did directly benefit from IFTAS Connect – I have an account there and read threads about moderation challenges, learning from the experiences of others.</p>

<p>While IFTAS was providing a valuable service to the fediverse, <a href="https://about.iftas.org/2025/02/06/funding-challenges-and-the-future-of-our-work/">they recently announced</a> that they were struggling to get funding:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Despite our best efforts to secure sustainable funding, IFTAS is now facing a critical financial shortfall. Without immediate support, we will be forced to severely curtail our activities in the next 60 days. With our current commitments we will be unable to pay our bills in April.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was one month ago, and indeed IFTAS just announced <a href="https://about.iftas.org/2025/03/03/iftas-service-shutdowns/">they are shutting down several services</a>.</p>

<p>This is going to be a big loss. As Laurens Hof at <a href="https://fediversereport.com/fediverse-report-106/"><em>The Fediverse Report</em> notes</a>, noncentralized social media needs some forums where folks can gather to discuss the the challenges they face:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>IFTAS, as a grassroots fediverse organisation, is one of the best-placed organisations to have build trust and provide a nexus around which such infrastructure could be build. IFTAS got pretty far with their rollout of FediCheck, which was building such a place for collaboration between server admins. Now that IFTAS will not be the center around which shared moderation infrastructure can be build [sic], will there be another organisation in the future to do so? Especially when IFTAS found out that getting funding for such a project is so difficult?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But is getting funding so difficult? I wonder.</p>

<p>That brings me to the provocation I dropped in the first paragraph: there may be a standards war brewing. To see that, let’s look at another organization that is spinning up as IFTAS is winding down.</p>

<h2 id="free-our-feeds">Free our Feeds</h2>
<p>In January 13 of this year, a consortium of actors, bloggers, academics and tech luminaries <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250113141611/http://freeourfeeds.com/">launched “Free Our Feeds”</a>, a new foundation based on the idea that “we can no longer let billionaires control our digital public square.” The announcement included a call for donations. As of March 5, Free our Feeds’s GoFundMe <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-us-free-social-media-from-billionaires">has raised $90K USD</a> – not quite the four million they wanted, but certainly not nothing.</p>

<p>What would Free Our Feeds do? Well, for one thing, “re-grant [money] to the community of innovators,” including folks doing content moderation. Another thing is to help develop an open protocol (namely ATProto, which is currently being developed by the Bluesky corporation).</p>

<p>Right as this group made this announcement, a lot of folks asked a basic question: <em>doesn’t this sort of thing already exist?</em> They were referring, of course, to ActivityPub, which has existed since 2018 and is an open standard (governed by the W3C) with a thriving ecosystem of applications.</p>

<p>But there’s another thing that existed at the time of the Free Our Feeds launch, an organization that was already innovating content moderation for the non-billionaire-controlled social web.</p>

<p>IFTAS.</p>

<p>Free Our Feeds does not mention the existence of IFTAS. (Initially, they didn’t even mention ActivityPub, adding a note about that protocol in their FAQ later).</p>

<p>So, while Free Our Feeds seeks money for their  unclear goals (as <a href="https://tante.cc/2025/01/13/but-does-it-free-our-feeds/">critics</a> <a href="https://rubenerd.com/free-our-feeds/">have argued</a>), another organization that has actually achieved tangible things – IFTAS – is folding for lack of funding.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-a-standards-war">Is This a Standards War?</h2>
<p>Free Our Feeds eventually included a note about ActivityPub in their FAQ:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ActivityPub is a W3C standard that enables interoperability between platforms like Mastodon, Flipboard, Ghost, Threads, and others. [ATProto] and ActivityPub should not be either/or options.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That answer also includes a link to <a href="https://socialwebfoundation.org/2025/01/13/free-our-feeds-and-algorithmic-pluralism/">a blog post</a> by Mallory Knodel of the Social Web Foundation. That post explains,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[The Free Our Feeds] campaign is an opportunity to develop the capacity needed for the open social web protocols– ActivityPub along with Bluesky’s AT Protocol– to better interoperate, leveraging the entire open social ecosystem to create a working demonstration of algorithmic pluralism at scale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The message is clear: It’s not either/or. It’s pluralism.</p>

<p>But is it?</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that <strong>there are now two standards</strong> – ATProto and ActivityPub – making the <strong>same fundamental claims to being <em>the</em> open standard</strong> that allows for decentralized social media.</p>

<p>Another fact is that ATProto and ActivityPub are <strong>architecturally very, very different.</strong> The former is what <a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/how-decentralized-is-bluesky/">Christine Lemmer-Webber calls</a> a “shared heap” structure, where an installation requires access to all the posts in the network, while the latter is server software that sends and fetches messages as the necessity arises. ATProto allows for “Personal Data Servers” – but these would rely on an infrastructure of indexes that likely will be prohibitively expensive. An ActivityPub server can run on a cheap server and still be a fully-fledged member of the fediverse.</p>

<p>Another fact is that <strong>both are overseen by very different bodies</strong> and <strong>both have come from very different processes.</strong> ActivityPub was developed at the W3C <a href="/2023/10/15/APnonStandard.html">largely independent of corporate interests</a>. The W3C remains the steward of ActivityPub. ATProto was born at Twitter and spun out into a separate, venture-capital funded corporation. While the Bluesky corporation <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/protocol-roadmap">promised in 2023</a> ATProto development will be shifted to the IETF, this still has not happened, and ATProto development is closely tied to a corporation that no doubt faces pressure to be profitable.</p>

<p>While there have been projects seeking to connect the two protocols – such as Bridgy – another fact is that this <strong>bridging is incredibly clumsy.</strong> To make a Mastodon account visible on Bluesky, one has to follow “@bsky.brid.gy@bsky.brid.gy”, and then a <em>separate</em> account is what is followed by Bluesky users. It works the same in reverse. Even when it works, posts are quite differently handled on either side. And none of this really addresses the fundamental architectural differences between ATProto and ActivityPub. Bridgy is a technical achievement, for sure, but I do not think it can be called “interoperability.”</p>

<p>Thus, while Free Our Feeds has declared their interest in fostering interoperability and building resources that could benefit the decentralized social web, the facts are that <strong>there are major organizational, cultural, and technical distinctions between these protocols</strong> and <strong>there are only so many resources to go around.</strong></p>

<p>In other words, it’s possible we are watching a “standards war” happening in real time. It’s not as apparent because the stakes are not the same as, for example, different railroad gauges or different ways to deliver electricity.</p>

<p>But there are stakes. This is social media, where we have been taught that more is always better. Bluesky is attracting more people than the fediverse. This matters. Which standard would be recognized as the decentralized social media standard? Who will get the resources? Who will get developer energy, funding, academic research, and moderation support? Who will attract media coverage?</p>

<h2 id="iftas-as-casualty-in-a-standards-war">IFTAS as Casualty in a Standards War</h2>
<p>The case of IFTAS folding while Free Our Feeds emerges indicates that maybe AT Proto will win this potential standards war. If Free Our Feeds does raise the money for its (amorphous) goals, while IFTAS fails to get support for its actual services, that is pretty telling.</p>

<p>If Free Our Feeds merely concentrates on what they believe is best for Bluesky – as seems to be the case, given their interest in sorting algorithms, AI, and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/who-owns-the-future-of-social-media-a-giant-leap-to-decentralize-core-components-of-blueskys-at-protocol-ecosystem-302387397.html">blockchains</a> – that is the most telling aspect of all.</p>

<p>Of course, it’s possible IFTAS has failed to raise funds for good reasons. Non-profits can and do fail. (Free our Feeds also might!)</p>

<p>But the failure of the broader tech, academic, and (frankly) celebrity sector to recognize and support an actually-existing trust and safety organization – one tied closely to ActivityPub – in favor of a relatively amorphous entity that is very tied to AT Proto is a troubling sign of how a potential standards war might turn out.</p>

In many ways, she’s not wrong. But once again people are ignoring an entirely other way of doing social media that can, in fact, fight fascism.</p>

<p>Rose’s article made the rounds in the social media feeds I follow. And for good reason. Many folks are deeply troubled – and frightened – of what’s happening in the USA. People who pay attention know that the difference between a democratic state and an authoritarian one is <em>indifference</em>, which is to say that if institutions are indifferent about stopping someone like Trump from abusing his power, he is de facto an authoritarian leader. And there’s <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-courts-guardrails-analysis-1.7457725">a lot of indifference in the US government right now</a>.</p>

<p>So people want to find a way to stop Trumpism, and they’re eager for guidance – hence the sharing of Rose’s article.</p>

<p>What is to be done? Well, Rose argues that there is no antidote to Trumpian poison to be found in merely taking to social media and posting about his (or Elon Musk’s, or Pete Hesgeth’s, or any other Trumpist’s) bizarre or cruel statements. “If there’s one thing I’d hoped people had learned going into the next four years of Donald Trump as president,” she writes, “it’s that spending lots of time online posting about what people in power are saying and doing is not going to accomplish anything. If anything, it’s exactly what they want.”</p>

<p>Rose points to the work of political theorists and sociologists, arguing that being outraged and overwhelmed is the point. “Thinkers like Jean-Paul Sartre and Hannah Arendt warned us that the point of this deluge is not to persuade, but to overwhelm and paralyze our capacity to act.” She draws on the work of <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/log-off-why-posting-and-politics-almost-never-mix-katherine-cross/78a509d4d3703d91?ean=9781736716861&amp;next=t&amp;next=t">Katherine Cross</a> to argue that corporate social media is all too happy to provide an outlet for the rage. Cross “documents how tech platforms encourage us, through their design affordances, to post and seethe and doomscroll into the void, always reacting and never acting.”</p>

<p>Cross’s language is an apt description of corporate social media – X and Meta properties are now full-on algorithmic outrage engines, designed to keep us looking, scrolling, and posting. (And never forget why: they sell our attention to marketers. That’s their whole purpose.)</p>

<p>Instead, as Rose argues, people need to get organized – to do actual, on-the-ground activism, rather than merely posting about the outage du jour.</p>

<h2 id="slactivism-20">Slactivism 2.0?</h2>
<p>One might be tempted to dismiss Rose’s argument because it’s not new. It’s basically a repetition of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slacktivism">“slacktivism”</a> complaint popularized by Evgeny Morozov in the early 2010s. (Morozov’s own argument repeated arguments made in the 1990s, but I will stick with 2010s on).</p>

<p>Against the backdrop of breathless proclamations about “Facebook revolutions” and “Twitter democracy,” Morozov argued that what was really happening was that corporate social media activism allowed people to confuse clicking “like” on a political post with actually doing something about it. Rose herself repeats this argument (by way of citing Cross): “the greatest [sin] is convincing ourselves that posting is a form of political activism, when it is at best a coping mechanism—an individualist solution to problems that can only be solved by collective action.”</p>

<p>The slacktivism critique probably reached its high water mark with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/09/world/africa/online-joseph-kony-and-a-ugandan-conflict-soar-to-topic-no-1.html"><em>Kony 2012</em> phenomenon</a>, a short Youtube video which promised viewers that they could bring an end to  Joseph Kony’s use of children as soldiers with “just a click.” Clicking, it was argued, is a far cry from on-the-ground, collective organizing to combat the use of children in warfighting in Uganda.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://us1-browse.startpage.com/av/anon-image?piurl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.pinimg.com%2F236x%2F18%2F4f%2F1e%2F184f1ef000b76e01e7364897acc7ab9a.jpg&amp;sp=1739636813Tad45153b3cc7ed4d39ba00847d5f0d1ff5fbabf86b300c0542af991a999fd134">memes mocking this notion</a> soon followed. The memes encapsulate the major critique of slacktivism: raising “awareness” of social ills does nothing to actually address them.</p>

<p>“Slacktivism” was thus contrasted with “real activism” – marches, protests, community organizing, raising and distributing resources, and the like.</p>

<p>So, we have a dichotomy here: either you’re posting and liking on social media, or you’re on the streets, organizing and fighting back. It’s a dichotomy that we’ve been hearing about since at least the 2010s.</p>

<p>Indeed, Rose’s argument also goes in this direction, updating it for 2025. She points to anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions and efforts to provide shelter for the unhoused. She argues that these arose from real organizing, not just posting. “Some of these efforts were coordinated online over Discord and secure messaging apps, but all of them arose from existing networks of neighbors and community organizers, some of whom have been organizing for decades.” Such real organizing is what we need: “when it comes to addressing the problems we face, no amount of posting or passive info consumption is going to substitute the hard, unsexy work of organizing.”</p>

<h2 id="beyond-the-dichotomy">Beyond the Dichotomy</h2>

<p>There are two ways out of the dichotomy between doomscrolling/posting and getting organized. One way is to argue that it is a false dichtomy – that posting and organizing aren’t mutually exclusive. Critics of the “slacktivism” complaint <a href="https://beyond.ubc.ca/online-activism-isnt-just-slacktivism/">have done that work</a>, arguing that online activism enables marginalized people to start getting involved, and that arguments that online activism is worthless discourage people from doing anything at all.</p>

<p>I won’t repeat these arguments, though I certainly talk about them when I teach classes about social movements. Instead, here I will point to another way out, one that I’ve been studying since before the “slacktivism” complaint gained prominence in the early 2010s.</p>

<p>It won’t surprise you to learn that I argue for alternative social media where its users – or, as I prefer, <em>members</em> – are in control. These systems have been around since the early 2010s – indeed, they arose right around the time of Morozov’s slacktivism complaint. The latest iteration is ActivityPub-enabled federated social media.</p>

<p>Can folks doomscroll on the fediverse? Yes. Can folks post on the fediverse? Yes. Might they post about the latest outrage of Trump? Yes, definitely.</p>

<p>Does that mean they are failing to fight incipient fascism? No.</p>

<p>In fact, I argue that the act of running, moderating, and participating in federated social media is precisely the sort of organizing that Rose calls for. It’s just taking place in a media environment, rather than, say, in an NGO’s offices in a city.</p>

<p>Communities who make their own codes of conduct collectively establish how they want to relate to one another. They make decisions about content moderation. They make decisions about federating and defederating with other instances. They are governing themselves online.</p>

<p>This is another example of the “hard, unsexy work of organizing.” Moreover, to quote Rose further: “We need to collectively decide what kind of world we actually do want, and what we’re willing to do to achieve it.” Exactly. And part of that world is the communication infrastructure. Who should own it? Who should govern it? To what purpose should it be put – marketing messages and consumerism, or collective sensemaking?</p>

<p>With Silicon Valley executives and media moguls openly allying themselves with Donald Trump – and with Musk, owner of a major communication platform, actively involved in the Trump administration – we need media that operates outside of corporate control. We need non-capitalist, non-centralized media.</p>

<p>Indeed, we already have it! It’s been around for quite some time! And if you want unsexy hard work, set up your own server, recruit people to it, and moderate it.</p>

<h2 id="the-art-of-forgetting">The Art of Forgetting</h2>
<p>It’s odd that I have to write this, because once again I feel like an actual, existing alternative to corporate social media exists.</p>

<p>But what’s odder to me still is that Rose ropes Bluesky into the same orbit as Twitter/X or Facebook:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many Twitter refugees made a good choice in migrating from Musk’s X to Bluesky, carving out a new online space that is inhospitable to bigoted debate bros and time-wasting trolls. But in their enemies’ absence, many of these Left-leaning posters have just reverted to dunking on each other, preferring the catharsis of sectarian conflict over the hard work of organizing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought Bluesky was supposed to be the alternative that allowed people more control? That puts algorithms in the hands of end users? That gives people choices? Instead, Rose is equating Bluesky with other corporate social media – it, like Meta or X, does not encourage “the hard work of organizing.”</p>

<p>I increasingly tend to agree with that equation. Bluesky PBC has taken venture capital funding. It will face pressure to monetize. And along with that, it seems less and less invested in developing actual ways to decentralize.</p>

<p>However, you might disagree. Let’s set that aside. For now, I will point out that the critique of social media as a space for mere posting, doomscrolling, and algorithmic manipulation simply does not apply to the fediverse. The fediverse <em>demands</em> the hard work of organizing.</p>

<p>But for Rose to write this article, the only way the argument works is to forget the existence of the fediverse.</p>

<p>In my time studying non-corporate social media, I’ve seen this forgetting again and again. Fortunately, I’ve also seen the activists who make, run, moderate and participate in these non-corporate alternatives keep going, in spite of being forgotten or ignored.</p>

<p>That gives me hope that we can post our way out of fascism… on <em>our</em> social media.</p>]]></content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="Alternative Social Media" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been mulling over Janus Rose’s recent 404 Media article, “You Can’t Post Your Way Out of Fascism.”.
