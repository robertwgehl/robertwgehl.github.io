&lt;p&gt;Organized by Jessa Lingel, Ashwin Nagappi, and myself, the preconference achieved one of its big goals: getting many researchers in a room to talk about alternative social media (ASM). Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other big goal was igniting a research agenda for ASM. Did we succeed?
&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;asm-research-futures&quot;&gt;ASM Research futures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say: “yes!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion during our roughly four hours was rich. First of all, Ashwin had the brilliant idea of building an ad-hoc timeline of social media, dating back to the 1970s through today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/smwall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A wall of post-it notes that creates a timeline of social media, starting with email in the 1970s through the fediverse today&quot; title=&quot;social media timeline&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The participants in the preconference remembered various social media, broadly construed, and posted notes about them to the wall.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This actually helped us see the variety of ways people were defining “social media” right away. It also showed us that there may have been bursts of activity in two key moments: the early 2010s (quite understandable) and right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-asm&quot;&gt;What are ASM?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This segued into a discussion about a key question: what are “alternative social media”? From my corner of the room, I heard two key words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;relational&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;emergent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, ASM are always in relation to something typically considered mainstream. This actually replicates a paper Roel Roscam Abbing and I are working on, where we will conclude with a similar observation. ASM are in relation to a mainstream, a relation that can change over time. RRA and I presented an early &lt;a href=&quot;https://nextcloud.robertwgehl.org/index.php/s/qkZBjbznzkjTbkT&quot;&gt;version of that paper back in May of this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other key word was “emergent,” in that alternative &lt;em&gt;practices&lt;/em&gt; often appear across many locations, including on mainstream corporate social media. These practices can influence both corporate &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; alternative social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even with this relative consensus, much as the conception of social media was very broad, so, too the conception of alternative social media. Some of us felt that this would hinder the field, replicating the worst of the alternative media debates of the 1990s-2000s. Others of us felt that the variety of meanings could aid in research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;methods-and-ethics&quot;&gt;Methods and Ethics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We next turned to ASM research methods – which were immediately tied to research ethics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, since ASM is hard to define, then it struck many of us that ethnographic or participatory methods are called for. We agreed that often we have to listen to communities as they define themselves as “alternative.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we also noted that we should be free to reject a community’s self-definition as “alternative” – it could be mere marketing. Or it could be a self-serving gloss on unethical replication of mainstream practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historical methods were also recommended, since tracing alternative practices (such as, for example, federated political practices) could shed light on contemporary social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also discussed approaches like the walk-through method or software studies approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there was controversy, it was over data-scraping methods. Readers of this blog know I am adverse to them on the fediverse (and I am working on a paper on this topic). However, participants argued that scraping may be warranted in situations where we study the alt-right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethics was, as it should be, a central consideration. The participants tended to agree with the basic idea of consent – a position I &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/25/ASMupdate-Warwick.html&quot;&gt;wholly endorse for the study of the fediverse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sticky bit, again, was in cases where researchers felt that consent would be hard to get, or interfere with the study: again, this tended to focus on studying right-wing alternative social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me (and many of the folks in the room, I believe), there’s a major upshot to ethical engagement with many ASM groups: we researchers can make a difference! We can do work that resonates with ASM communities: we can ask them what they need and how we could help provide it through research. I really don’t think Facebook or Twitter cares a bit about critical social media research… but people on the fediverse, for example, might. If we do this right, we can actually help grow a more ethical social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m down for that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;future-steps&quot;&gt;Future steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now building an email listserv for researchers interested in the field of ASM, as well as a Zotero library. I particularly hope that collecting a bibliography might shed light on the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also talking about meeting again, either virtually or in person. Watch this space for more!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="alternative social media" /><category term="Association of Internet Researchers" /><category term="Goal 2" /><summary type="html">On October 18, at 8.30 am, a group of about 30 Internet Scholars gathered for a Association of Internet Researchers preconference, called “Building an Alternative Social Media Network.” Organized by Jessa Lingel, Ashwin Nagappi, and myself, the preconference achieved one of its big goals: getting many researchers in a room to talk about alternative social media (ASM).

It’s my favorite conference. And to give AOIR even more credit, they were one of the first professional academic organizations to set up &lt;a href=&quot;https://aoir.social&quot;&gt;their own Mastodon instance&lt;/a&gt; (I participate in that project by helping run the instance).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there, I will present a paper about the creation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/&quot;&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt;, the protocol that allows the contemporary fediverse to run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Titled “The Non-Standard Standard: A Critical Genealogy of ActivityPub,” I will argue that ActivityPub is a very unusual standard. While it was created by a W3C working group, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg&quot;&gt;the Social Web Working Group&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2023/Process-20230612/&quot;&gt;a W3C standard process&lt;/a&gt;, there were many non-standard aspects to its creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I’ll sum up my findings, arguing that there are four ways in which ActivityPub is a non-standard standard. This work is informed by reading the Social Web Working Group (SocialWG) meeting minutes, interviews with SocialWG members, and a study of historical documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comments are very welcome, since this is going to be a chapter in my forthcoming book about the fediverse, &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/17/OxfordUP.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Move Slowly and Build Bridges&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;four-non-standard-aspects-of-the-activitypub-standard&quot;&gt;Four Non-Standard Aspects of the ActivityPub standard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-corporate-social-media-was-not-involved&quot;&gt;1) Corporate social media was not involved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate social media wasn’t involved in the production of ActivityPub. At best, corporations like Facebook or Twitter (as they were known at the time) treated the SocialWG with benign neglect. At worst, they saw the group as utterly irrelevant to the future of social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t as if the SocialWG didn’t try to get corporate social media involved: they repeatedly reached out to Facebook, Twitter, Sina Weibo, and other major social media corporations. But none of these companies got involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is very unusual in the world of internet standards. Companies such as IBM, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Meta, Oracle, or Samsung pay membership fees and regularly send employees to standards-setting bodies, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force and the World Wide Web Consortium, in order to shape the standards that govern their industries. In fact, as much as corporations like Apple, Microsoft, and Google appear to be competing with one another, in reality they often cooperate when building standards, because the general rule is that standardized technologies are good for business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when it came to the SocialWG, as ActivityPub co-author Amy Guy told me, “None of the big players… no one took us seriously. No one saw [the SocialWG] as a threat. No one expected it to go anywhere…. The feeling was, it was small beans, and it wasn’t worth their time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-the-social-web-working-group-didnt-make-a-standard--they-made-seven&quot;&gt;2) The Social Web Working Group Didn’t Make a Standard – They Made &lt;em&gt;Seven&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of settling on one approach to standardizing social media – in other words, a single, standard approach – the group made &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/social/publications/&quot;&gt;seven standards&lt;/a&gt;. For a typical W3C working group, that is decidedly non-standard behavior – most groups make one or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on interviews, it’s clear this happened because of a lack of corporate involvement. Say what we will about corporate social media, they at least have a clear goal in mind: more users. More people’s lives to datamine, more eyeballs on behavioral ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the SocialWG members took a predominantly academic or theoretical approach, which initially resulted in multiple factions each championing their own approaches. The group easily could have produced zero standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in a compromise, the SocialWG decided to produce many standards. In a sense, as SocialWG member Bengo told me, the group succeeded &lt;em&gt;too much&lt;/em&gt; – it made many standards, instead of just one or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this said, while lack of corporate involvement might have unmoored the group somewhat, the interviewees I spoke to said they were grateful to make standards that did not simply support the needs of corporate social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-activitypub-almost-didnt-happen&quot;&gt;3) ActivityPub Almost Didn’t Happen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the biggee. ActivityPub – the most successful product of the SocialWG by far – almost didn’t get done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One big reason was that a federation protocol was considered to be optional by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2013/socialweb/social-wg-charter.html&quot;&gt;SocialWG’s charter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But an even bigger hurdle came in the face of resistance to ActivityPub from within the SocialWG itself. As an example of the pushback, consider this Mean Girls meme:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/fetchfederation.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mean Girls &amp;quot;Stop Trying to Make Federation Happen&amp;quot; meme&quot; title=&quot;Stop Trying to Make Federation Happen&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A variation on the Mean Girls &quot;stop trying to make fetch happen,&quot; adapted to refer to the federation protocol&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for us, ActivityPub advocates such as eventual co-author &lt;a href=&quot;https://dustycloud.org/&quot;&gt;Christine Lemmer-Webber&lt;/a&gt; weren’t taking no for an answer. Lemmer-Webber pushed back hard against the resistance to ActivityPub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even with Lemmer-Webber championing it, time was running out: the SocialWG charter set the end of the group to be mid-2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took Mastodon to save ActivityPub. &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/mastodon-and-the-w3c-f75f376f422&quot;&gt;Mastodon implemented a draft version of ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt;, and because this was a big deal, the W3C gave the SocialWG &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; deadline extensions, now known as the “Mastodon Extension.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mastodon and ActivityPub connected because of their respective developers’ desire for safety for queer and trans people. Just as “the fediverse has historically been extremely queer,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://fossandcrafts.org/episodes/053-fediverse-reflections-while-the-bird-burns.html&quot;&gt;Christine Lemmer-Webber explains that ActivityPub was, as well&lt;/a&gt;. Lemmer-Webber says ActivityPub “was largely developed by queer people – myself included – and including also implementation developers.” Four of the five ActivityPub authors self-identified as queer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Mastodon, Lemmer-Webber recalls that a large number of its “key contributors, kind of set the tone by pushing for certain features and pushing for kind of certain cultural norms that were to support queer communities that did not feel well-supported by Twitter.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, ActivityPub solved many problems for Mastodon – it functioned as a privacy-respecting upgrade over &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OStatus&quot;&gt;OStatus&lt;/a&gt; (the original protocol used by Mastodon), a means to break away from harassment coming from some &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@Trevatos/gnu-social-pleroma-and-the-mastodon-culture-conflict-3b10872937c2&quot;&gt;GNU social servers&lt;/a&gt;, and a way to further differentiate itself from Twitter. And Mastodon helped ActivityPub by giving its authors a big implementation – gold in the world of standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-mastodon-prompted-us-to-ignore-12-of-activitypub&quot;&gt;4) Mastodon Prompted Us to Ignore 1/2 of ActivityPub&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while Mastodon saved ActivityPub from oblivion, it has also effectively erased half of the ActivityPub standard from the internet. This is because the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.joinmastodon.org/api/&quot;&gt;Mastodon API&lt;/a&gt; is dominant across the fediverse, with non-Mastodon projects adopting it. This is in spite of the fact that the ActivityPub protocol includes an API for clients, which would allow end clients to connect to any fediverse server regardless of what software the server is running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This client-to-server portion of ActivityPub is cited by SocialWG members as their favorite part of the standard. But it is effectively ignored. So while ActivityPub’s creators are grateful to Mastodon for saving their work, Mastodon is also a cause for lament on the part of the ActivityPub authors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implications-for-the-future&quot;&gt;Implications for the Future?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I found the story of ActivityPub, the non-standard standard, to be fascinating. Obviously, it’s also important to the history of Mastodon. As Evan Prodromou told me in an interview, the meeting of Mastodon and ActivityPub at just the right moment in both their development “has changed history. It could be a very different story now. A different story for Mastodon and a different story for the social web.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wonder how this story will affect the future, as well. People are currently reviving the SocialWG, with debates happening right now about what its scope should be. Given the history I’ve observed, I would argue that concentrating on the SocialWG’s most successful product, ActivityPub, may be the wisest move.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="ActivityPub" /><category term="Goal 2" /><category term="Move Slowly and Build Bridges" /><summary type="html">In a couple days, I head to Philadelphia for the 2023 version of the Association of Internet Researchers conference.

My initial idea was to get into a debate with my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://test.roelof.info/&quot;&gt;Roel Roscam Abbing&lt;/a&gt;, who is an incredibly deep thinker and is writing what will no doubt be a foundational dissertation about the fediverse. We were hoping to prompt a discussion about importable, instance blocklists on the fediverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He and I disagree their utility. He thinks they’re bad; I think they’re good. I’ll let him post his reasons why, but here I wanted to share my defense of them. What follows is a longer version of what I planned on presenting at Fediforum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, when people discuss ways to improve the fediverse, they talk about technical solutions – extensions to ActivityPub, say, or new layers on the network. Instead, my take is informed by my research for &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/08/17/OxfordUP.html&quot;&gt;my forthcoming book&lt;/a&gt;, where I explore the history, politics, and cultural practices of the fediverse. To defend blocklists, I draw on this history, politics, and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most powerful things that has emerged on the fediverse is the culture of Codes of Conduct. The fediverse would be a very different –- and worse –- place without this practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practice of using codes of conduct was not a technical achievement. It has little to do with ActivityPub. Instead, it came as part of the zeitgeist –- COCs were being &lt;a href=&quot;https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/codes-of-conduct-when-being-excellent-is-not-enough&quot;&gt;advocated for in tech circles in the mid-2010s&lt;/a&gt;, and of course Mastodon was developed right at the same time. Mastodon.social and others adopted COCs, and the pattern was set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, research shows that there are many overlaps across fediverse codes of conduct, such that we see what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_Marion_Young&quot;&gt;ethical theorists&lt;/a&gt; might call a thin set of shared global values. A colleague and I argue elsewhere that this practice gives rise to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2022.2147400&quot;&gt;“covenantal fediverse,”&lt;/a&gt; where like-minded instances band together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another social innovation is the emergence of the instance as the fundamental unit of the fediverse. I know that there was a desire by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2013/socialweb/social-wg-charter.html&quot;&gt;authors of ActivityPub to have a client-to-server structure&lt;/a&gt;, but we ended up with instances as the key site of organization. This is a happy accident. Instances admins can gain knowledge about how the network works, where the good and bad actors are, and they can protect members –- especially new members who are just joining the network. For better or worse –-and I think it’s for better –- we think at the community/instance level, with admins as leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings me to blocklists. With the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.1.0&quot;&gt;implementation of blocklist importing in Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, we’re seeing a logical next step –- not just the sharing of codes of conduct, but cross-instance, inter-admin sharing of knowledge about what Ro aptly calls &lt;a href=&quot;https://thebad.space/&quot;&gt;“the bad space”&lt;/a&gt; of the fediverse. This is a recognition –- and blocking –- of the swath of the internet that fails to meet the thin set of global ethical values. Contemporary blocklists are a codification of early social practices, like #fediblock and backchanneling between covenantally-linked instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://nextcloud.robertwgehl.org/index.php/s/G34Y5X2PoNBq5Xp&quot;&gt;noted elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve benefited from this history. When I set up AOIR.social in March, I was aided by imported blocklists. There is a great deal of knowledge on the fediverse about the patterns of “free speech absolutism” (read: racist, misogynist, transmisic, or CSAM-sharing). Free speech absolutism has a long history in free software social media. But because people have recognized the freezepeach pattern – indeed, because they’ve suffered from it – they have codifed their knowledge in blocklist form. Installing a blocklist on day one allowed AoIR.social to benefit from this painfully-gained knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are counterarguments, of course. The danger of a blocklist is that it is tied to personalities –- many people cite the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@obvious_humor/dont-use-randi-harper-s-blocklist-use-naziblocker-instead-db16cd666d49&quot;&gt;Randi Harper case&lt;/a&gt;. Others suggest that blocklists are too tied to centralized, corporate social media. But I think we run the risk of the genetic fallacy by assuming previous, harmful Twitter activities will necessarily be replicated on the fedi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countering the danger of the blocklist run by a single person, we’re seeing nascent governance structures around blocklists, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://nivenly.org/docs/papers/fsep/&quot;&gt;Ro’s The Bad Space collaboration with Nivenly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this brings me to my main point. Much the same as we’ve had an emergent set of ethical principles arise through the cultural practice of COCs, organized at the instance level, shared instance blocklists –- with governance structures that cross instances –- could result in another cultural innovation: affirmative, cross-instance governance. The blocklist becomes a vehicle for such collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It won’t be easy, by any means. In fact, it is really hard (just ask the people helping to build the lists). But so was developing codes of conduct. And so too is running an instance. It’s all social practice. It’s all hard. Building a new way of being social is hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we’re gaining skills, day by day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="moderation" /><category term="goal 2" /><summary type="html">So I tried to take part in Fediforum today, but I wasn’t really able to participate.

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I sent a proposal (a short synopsis of the book, audience considerations, and two sample chapters) to Oxford. They moved &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;. They recruited two peer reviewers who turned around reviews very quickly, and then Oxford’s editorial board reviewed the project. I just received a contract based on these reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word I got from Oxford is that they are excited about the project – and about the fediverse. That’s really good news, because the normal advice an author would get is to promote one’s work on corporate social media. But I think that any book about the fediverse has to be talked about on the fediverse. Maybe this project can help other academic authors break away from Twitter/X and Facebook/Meta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, fediverse, watch for &lt;a href=&quot;https://aoir.social/@rwg&quot;&gt;posts about this book from me on Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;. I’m also committing to sharing details about the book here on this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-im-writing-about&quot;&gt;What I’m writing about&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more about the book, I’d first point you to &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/01/06/Goal2.html&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, which is the earliest description of this project. Things have evolved somewhat since that post, but for now, that post from early 2022 gives you some insight into what I’m writing about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have a series of posts I’m writing about the creation of ActivityPub – you can see &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/01/20/ActivityPub1.html&quot;&gt;part 1 here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/05/09/ActivityPub2.html&quot;&gt;part 2 here&lt;/a&gt;. Watch for more of these, since one chapter will focus on the creation of ActivityPub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, watch out for &lt;a href=&quot;https://fossacademic.tech/tags/asm%20update.html&quot;&gt;“Alternative Social Media Updates”&lt;/a&gt; – those posts discuss news items that are relevant to the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I also have some co-authored journal articles on &lt;a href=&quot;https://robertwgehl.org/text/pubs/Zulli%20et%20al.%20-%202020%20-%20Rethinking%20the%20%e2%80%9csocial%e2%80%9d%20in%20%e2%80%9csocial%20media%e2%80%9d%20Insight.pdf&quot;&gt;rethinking social media&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2022.2147400&quot;&gt;codes of conduct&lt;/a&gt; that also give you some insight into the project. I do have a chapter focusing on codes of conduct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also plan on writing about specific chapters openly on this blog. Watch for such posts in the coming months. As an example of what that will look like, &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/02/10/bumpAndSlump.html&quot;&gt;this post on the “killer hype cycle”&lt;/a&gt; is now part of chapter 1 of the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-im-writing-it&quot;&gt;How I’m writing it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have written about how I’m doing the research. I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/04/17/InterviewWorkflow.html&quot;&gt;talked about my use of interviews here&lt;/a&gt; – that process is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/05/26/Subscribe.html&quot;&gt;wrote about my approach to using subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; as a way to support artists and creative folks on the fediverse – that is still ongoing, and will be relevant to a chapter on creativity on the fediverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I have my &lt;a href=&quot;https://fossacademic.tech/tags/goal%201.html&quot;&gt;“Goal 1” series of posts&lt;/a&gt; about using FOSS tools to write – I will continue to write about using Zotero, Zettlr, Nextcloud and other tools to write this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the next 12 months will be hectic, but I’m very gratified to have a publisher lined up for this book. This work has been a focus of mine for many years. I’ve met some incredible, smart, insightful people on the fediverse – I hope this book, and this process, will be up to their standards.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="Goal 2" /><category term="Goal 1" /><summary type="html">I am very excited to announce that my next book, Move Slowly and Building Bridges: Mastodon, the Fediverse, and the Struggle for Democratic Social Media will be published by Oxford University Press.

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-challenges-in-moderation-and-new-responses&quot;&gt;New challenges in moderation and new responses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Content warning: abuse mention&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine most readers of this blog saw news about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/news/addressing-child-exploitation-federated-social-media&quot;&gt;Stanford Internet Observatory report&lt;/a&gt; on child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on the fediverse. I know I did. I’m currently the admin of &lt;a href=&quot;https://aoir.social/&quot;&gt;AoIR.social&lt;/a&gt;, and the report came out while I was in the middle of moving apartments – and in the middle of relying on dodgy mobile hotspot internet. Regardless of the bad connection and stress of unpacking, the report’s publication prompted me to immediately do an audit of AoIR.social’s instance blocklist to see if we were facing any risk of having CSAM hit our server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am quite confident AoIR.social is in good shape. Why? Because on day one of AoIR.social (months before the Stanford report), I imported blocklists. First, I grabbed &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeberg.org/oliphant/blocklists&quot;&gt;Oliphant’s Tier 0 Blocklist&lt;/a&gt;, and later &lt;a href=&quot;https://thebad.space/&quot;&gt;Ro’s The Bad Space&lt;/a&gt; list. Both of those are based on community consensus about who are the bad actors on the fediverse, and by importing the lists into AoIR.social’s moderation panel, bad actors – including the ones implicitly identified in Stanford report – were already blocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, while the Stanford report was scary as hell, the community has been aware of bad instances for a while now. The community is sharing knowledge about the bad servers and is blocking them. As one admin put it to me, any fedi admin with any consciousness about moderation has been blocking the bad instances for a while now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the time since the report came out, I’ve interviewed Oliphant, Ro, and other respected fediverse admins and they are advocating for easier use of blocklists to prevent the fediverse from being swamped with bad servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, a great response to moderation challenges is coming in the form of Ro’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://nivenly.org/docs/papers/fsep/&quot;&gt;Fediverse Safety Enhancement Project&lt;/a&gt;. This project is about automated, consensus-based subscription blocklists. The proposed interface looks a lot like one of my favorite tools, The &lt;a href=&quot;https://pi-hole.net/&quot;&gt;Pi-Hole ad-blocking system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;huge.&lt;/em&gt; There are so many interesting things to figure out, from the technical to social. Special attention should be paid to how such lists will be governed. The good news is there are folks working on that exact issue, including Ro and Oliphant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hint, hint, fellow ASM academics: this is a good topic to study! I know Ro and people like him would welcome academic knowledge about how to improve this new form of moderation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, if you’re interested in supporting Ro’s project, I recommend giving (you gotta give!) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gofundme.com/f/a-new-way-to-social-media&quot;&gt;to his GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

This will take place in Philadelphia on October 18. From what we’ve seen, we’re just short of full capacity. If you’re going to AOIR, there may be still time to sign up if you haven’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nate Tkacz, Carlos Cámara-Menoyo, and Fangzhou Zhang put on a wonderful, and intensive, two days focused on Mastodon and the broader fediverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particularly of value, I thought, was the second day, which was unfortunately not streamed. We gathered together to talk about research ethics and methods. I posted some notes about what we said on the fediverse, using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aoir.social/tags/mastosymposium&quot;&gt;#MastoSymposium hashtag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my view, one of the most important conversations we need to have – and openly have – is about research ethics &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; the fediverse. I talked about this at length &lt;a href=&quot;https://nextcloud.robertwgehl.org/index.php/s/G34Y5X2PoNBq5Xp&quot;&gt;in my plenary presentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the point was hammered home for me on day 2 by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://systerserver.net/&quot;&gt;SysterServer&lt;/a&gt; collective, a group that hosts some instances and who attended the workshop. They aren’t academics, so they aren’t concerned with filling up CVs. But they have needs. Ethical research &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; them could help address their needs. Our research ought to resonate with the fediverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s next? I believe we can continue this conversation at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aoir.org/aoir2023/preconfworkshops/#building&quot;&gt;AOIR preconference&lt;/a&gt; that several of us are hosting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, let’s keep talking research ethics on the fediverse – a conversation that has been happening for years – see &lt;a href=&quot;https://apintandaparma.club/katlh/research-ethics-and-the-fediverse&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogghoran.se/2020/01/27/on-scraping-mastodon/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sunclipse.org/wp-content/downloads/2020/01/open-letter.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for just three examples.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="ASM update" /><category term="Goal 2" /><category term="FOSS finds" /><summary type="html">This update focuses on the University of Warwick Mastodon Research Symposium.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">ASM Update, June 16 2023</title><link href="https://fossacademic.tech/2023/06/16/ASMupdate1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="ASM Update, June 16 2023" /><published>2023-06-16T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-06-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://fossacademic.tech/2023/06/16/ASMupdate1</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://fossacademic.tech/2023/06/16/ASMupdate1.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NB: I’ve started an alternative social media email list, and I regularly email the list with news from the world of ASM.

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an update on the world of ASM – at least as I see it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reddit-meltdown&quot;&gt;Reddit meltdown&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never was a Redditor, but even so, it’s hard not to notice what’s going on over there: what can only be called a labor strike on the part of subreddit moderators, done in protest to changes in the Reddit API. Specifically, subreddit moderators are making their subs private.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you guess that there are alternatives to Reddit, you guessed right. One that I knew about is &lt;a href=&quot;https://join-lemmy.org/&quot;&gt;Lemmy&lt;/a&gt;. However, I’ve also learned about &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ernestwisniewski/kbin&quot;&gt;Kbin&lt;/a&gt;. From what I understand, both are gaining new members. And I also have seen people join Mastodon and cite the Reddit meltdown as the reason why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all bears watching, particularly in terms of moderation and governance discussions. (And if you know more about what’s going on, please let me know!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;warwick&quot;&gt;Warwick&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week, the Centre for Interdisciplinary Methods will host a &lt;a href=&quot;https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/4d682da3-3b4e-4909-9239-743d86cc7dcc@09bacfbd-47ef-4465-9265-3546f2eaf6bc&quot;&gt;Mastodon Tools and Research workshop&lt;/a&gt;. I have the honor of giving the plenary address, and you can see the abstract in that link. Basically, I’ll be talking about the struggles of queer and Black members to make the fediverse a better space, and how the Association of Internet Researchers will need to acknowledge that history on its aoir.social instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program includes a lot of people on this list. I’m really looking forward to the event – I’m going to take a ton of notes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;noncentralized-origin-stories&quot;&gt;Noncentralized Origin Stories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, the Colorado Media Lab &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.colorado.edu/lab/medlab/2023/06/06/open-social-media-origin-stories&quot;&gt;hosted a discussion&lt;/a&gt; by Christine Lemmer-Webber, Rabble (aka Evan Henshaw-Plath), and Golda Vez. Each of these are heavily involved in noncentralized protocol development. Lemmer-Webber is a co-author of ActivityPub and is currently working on &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/spritely/ocappub&quot;&gt;OcaPPub&lt;/a&gt;. Rabble worked on Indymedia, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Scuttlebutt&quot;&gt;Secure Scuttlebutt&lt;/a&gt;, and now &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostr&quot;&gt;Nostr&lt;/a&gt;. Vez is involved with BlueSky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation gets a bit technical at points, but there’s plenty of history and discussion of content moderation mixed in, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;humbernews&quot;&gt;Humber.news&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I don’t know if I shared this, but here’s an interesting pedagogical project: &lt;a href=&quot;https://humber.news&quot;&gt;humber.news&lt;/a&gt;, run by Mike Wise, a journalism professor at Humber College in Toronto. Mike tells me that humber.news is a Mastodon instance he’s using in teaching journalism students about the fediverse. In my view, it’s a much-needed project; journalists will have to adjust their approaches if they want to share news and get news from the fediverse.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="ASM update" /><category term="Goal 2" /><category term="FOSS finds" /><summary type="html">NB: I’ve started an alternative social media email list, and I regularly email the list with news from the world of ASM.

The &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/01/20/ActivityPub1.html&quot;&gt;first one is here&lt;/a&gt;. Future posts to come.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned several months ago, my book about Mastodon and the rest of the fediverse can’t be complete without a deep understanding of ActivityPub, the protocol that powers the fediverse. ActivityPub itself is getting a bit of love in the press (see this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/20/23689570/activitypub-protocol-standard-social-network&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; for an example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to understand ActivityPub, we have to look at the group that created it, the W3C’s Social Web Working Group, or SocialWG for short. They posted their meeting minutes on the Web and I have read &lt;em&gt;all of them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous post on the SocialWG minutes, I focused on the very early years, 2014 to 2015, finding that the period was dominated by organizational issues – how to meet, how to make decisions, and so on. In this section, I will cover the development of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/&quot;&gt;ActivityStreams 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, the first goal of the SocialWG charter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;social-syntax&quot;&gt;Social Syntax&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the SocialWG’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2013/socialweb/social-wg-charter.html&quot;&gt;chartered goals&lt;/a&gt; was the production of a “a common JSON-based syntax for social data.” One potential source for this was “ActivityStreams,” an already-existing format for labeling online activities. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Activity_Streams_(format)&amp;amp;oldid=1153983815&quot;&gt;Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt; on this gives an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The standard provides a general way to represent activities. For instance, the sentence “Jack added Hawaii to his list of places to visit” would be represented in ActivityStreams as actor:jack, verb:add, object:Hawaii, target:placestovisit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While ActivityStreams was already in wide use, unless I’m mistaken, it was not codified as an official W3C standard. The SocialWG was to draw on the work of the informal &lt;a href=&quot;https://activitystrea.ms/specs/json/1.0/&quot;&gt;ActivityStreams community&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, James Snell, one of the key members of the ActivityStreams Community, got involved in the SocialWG and helped with this process. Spoiler alert: ActivityStreams 2.0 would be the ultimate result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how far along ActivityStreams was prior to the SocialWG, what’s interesting about a “social syntax” is a fundamental question: how does one capture human sociality in a vocabulary? As SocialWG member wilkie &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/2015-01-06-minutes&quot;&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt;: “we should get philosophical :) we are trying to capture the entirity of human creativity. the challenge is not getting overwhelmed while also not being too limiting.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were fascinating discussions in the minutes about terms. An example is a debate that happened in April 2014: should Activity Streams 2.0 use “person” or “profile”? Here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/2015-04-14-minutes&quot;&gt;snippet of the discussion&lt;/a&gt; between Evan Prodromou and Amy Guy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;eprodrom: I feel like the Person is enough to justify a Profile, or if there are other kinds of profile, we could use other objects. such as Corporation etc having profiles for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… the biggest issue that a Person having a Profile that people may have other aspects or personalities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;rhiaro: a person can have multiple profiles, but maybe persons and profiles don’t need to be modelled separately in the vocab (unsure)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;eprodrom: for instance, my interest in baseball or poker may have different personalities facing different social areas
… I feel like it is a complicated and fine-tuned type of concept that can be mapped on multiple accounts
… my feeling is that requiring that all users have multiple profiles is unnecessarily complex for the general case&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, about a year later, they eventually resolved to use “Person,” with the caveat that a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/2015-05-04-minutes&quot;&gt;“person” need not be a “physical/real person”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see how complex this can get: standardizing online sociality in a set of vocabulary terms is no simple matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And I should note that the question of Person/Profile is still very much open, in spite of the SocialWG’s resolution. Consider Christine Lemmer-Webber’s current project &lt;a href=&quot;https://spritely.institute/goblins/&quot;&gt;Spritely Goblins&lt;/a&gt; and its emphasis on profiles.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;corporate-refusal&quot;&gt;Corporate Refusal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so to make a “social syntax,” one needs a vocabulary, a set of terms that describes what people do when they’re being social. Back in the mid-2010s, there was of course one key source for such knowledge: corporate social media sites, such as Facebook and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They had APIs that no doubt did much of the work of describing the units of a social vocabulary, right? Indeed, back in 2009, Facebook even used the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20090430134956/http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;amp;articleId=9132182&amp;amp;intsrc=news_ts_head&quot;&gt;“activity streams” idea for its API&lt;/a&gt;, so clearly Facebook would get involved?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if the organization that &lt;em&gt;creates standards that power the World Wide Web&lt;/em&gt; – the W3C – is involved, then perhaps Twitter and other corporations should get involved, too, and have a hand in shaping resulting standards?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SocialWG minutes are marked by many instances of the group reaching out to Twitter, Facebook, Google, and other major corporations to get involved. Here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/2015-09-29-minutes&quot;&gt;but one of many&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;eprodrom: one thing i wanted to quickly point out is in previous converstaions we’ve talked about having some participation by non-members, inviting outside participation
… it may be good to think about what we want to do and so we can put out invitations to the public or specific developers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;tantek: i agree. i think the participation that we wanted to focus on previously is around implementers in particular
… specifically, implementers of social websites, popular existing social web services
… i have a bunch of contacts at twitter if they’d want to swing by for a bit, even informally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/2014-11-18-minutes&quot;&gt;studied the APIs of Twitter&lt;/a&gt; very early on, and so it makes sense they would want Twitter engineers involved in the SocialWG standard creation. Twitter never got involved, though. Later, after ActivityStreams 2.0 was finished, there was excitement that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/2016-10-18-minutes&quot;&gt;Twitter might implement it&lt;/a&gt;. But Twitter never did this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading the minutes as a whole, over time, you can see the hope simply die that any corporate social media would get involved. Instead, at a certain point, not having corporate involvement became something of a virtue. Consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/2016-06-06-minutes&quot;&gt;this statement from Tantek&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;tantek: we have seen with the examples of twitter and facebook there have been tons of business that have been built around either one of those, and ther ehas been a slow attrition of tightening apis, cutting off, etc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this prescient statement from Sandro Hawke (in the same meeting):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;sandro: all the media companies that are built around twitter don’t feel threatened or endangered by twitter
… if its started to be an unreliable or evil utility they would want some open replacement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this said, the corporate way of doing social was a constant touchpoint throughout the life of the SocialWG – the members constantly ask “how does Facebook do this?” or “How does Twitter describe that?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-stories&quot;&gt;User Stories&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if corporate social media is not involved, then how could the SocialWG specify a social syntax? The answer came in one of the most fascinating aspects of the SocialWG minutes: user stories (otherwise called “use cases”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea here is that they would write short stories about users doing social things, and then break those stories down into the terms they sought for their vocabulary. Here’s the first user story they adopted, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/federatedsocialweb/wiki/SWAT0&quot;&gt;Social Web Acid Test&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;With his phone, Dave takes a photo of Tantek and uploads it using a service&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Dave tags the photo with Tantek&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Tantek gets a notification on another service that he’s been tagged in a photo&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Evan, who is subscribed to Dave, sees the photo on yet another service&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Evan comments on the photo&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;David and Tantek receive notifications that Evan has commented on the photo&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/01/20/ActivityPub1.html&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, creating User Stories would be the responsibility of a sibling group, the Social Web Interest Group. That group would go on to produce about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/Social_API/User_stories&quot;&gt;90 user stories like the one above&lt;/a&gt;, but would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/2015-02-03-minutes&quot;&gt;ultimately settle on seven&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, user stories exemplify what I call &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Reverse-Engineering-Social-Media-Capitalism/dp/1439910359&quot;&gt;critical reverse engineering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; – taking apart existing practices, deriving abstractions from those practices, and then re-implementing those abstractions in a new (and better) way. Since corporate social media companies weren’t coming to the table to agree on a standard, the SocialWG simply told simple stories and developed their vocabulary (and Social API, the focus of a later post) from those stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;success&quot;&gt;Success!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they weren’t able to attract representatives from corporate social media, the SocialWG did get their first win: ActivityStreams 2.0 drafts were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/2015-06-30-minutes&quot;&gt;published in June of 2015&lt;/a&gt; and the Candidate Recommendation appeared later that year. ActivityStreams 2.0 is now a key part of ActivityPub – but that’s a story for later.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="Goal 2" /><category term="ActivityPub" /><summary type="html">NB: This is the second in a series of posts where I will share my notes on my readings of the minutes of the Social Web Working Group. The first one is here. Future posts to come. As I mentioned several months ago, my book about Mastodon and the rest of the fediverse can’t be complete without a deep understanding of ActivityPub, the protocol that powers the fediverse. ActivityPub itself is getting a bit of love in the press (see this Verge article for an example). And to understand ActivityPub, we have to look at the group that created it, the W3C’s Social Web Working Group, or SocialWG for short. They posted their meeting minutes on the Web and I have read all of them.
