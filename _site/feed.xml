&lt;p&gt;In this journal article, Keilback and Pabiś note that “Various [media studies] authors are pointing out that every media product (content or device) is based on the extraction of raw material and creates an enormous amount of waste, thereby emphasising the finite nature of Earth’s resources.” However, “While there is no doubt that these publications are extremely valuable, the state of our planet leaves us wondering if this is all media scholars can do. Given the climate emergency, we both consider the transition of media studies towards a more environmentally aware discipline imperative.” They go on to distinguish eco-modernism, the idea that we can use technology to avoid the climate catastrophe while still maintaining economic growth, with degrowth thinking, which suggests that the imperative to grow is the reason why we’re in this mess, and that de-growing the use of technology has to be on the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This media festival, which celebrates videos that weigh in at less than 5MB, is cited by Keilbach and Pabis as an example of degrowth. Rather than making HD movies – and hence taking up more and more bandwidth and energy – the Small File approach is to make small art that can still move audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

January 9, 2022.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been a big story in the past few weeks. A Javascript library developer named Marak has corrupted his own code and pushed it to Github, causing applications to break. Marak’s stated reason is that corporations are making a fortune by using his code, but he himself cannot pay his bills. There’s a lot to discuss, but this incident is interesting to me in that it’s at once a story about #politicaleconomy – how can devs get compensated for their work? – and also about #security. In this sense, human security. Can we have FOSS security if developers can’t eat? (Hint: I don’t think so).&lt;/p&gt;

December 11, 2021.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, Xe discusses why they won’t code unless it’s for money. Why not? Because to provide free software is to be exploited by large corporations. The Marak case wasn’t even on the radar at this point (at least, I don’t think it was); rather, Xe is referring to the work of patching the Java vulnerability in Log4j2, which was done at a fast pace over the holidays and was not compensated. Xe argues that, if a corporation is so dependant on a FOSS library, they ought to at least donate money to the devs who maintain the library. As they write, “I’ve had this kind of conversation with people before and I’ve gotten a surprising amount of resistance to the prospect of actually making sure that the random smattering of volunteers that LITERALLY MAKE THEIR COMPANY RUN are able to make rent. There is this culture of taking from open source without giving anything back. It is like the problems of the people who make the dependencies are irrelevant.”&lt;/p&gt;

Accessed January 11, 2022.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this 9 January 2022 podcast episode, Chris Fisher interviews Dave Jones of Podcastingindex.org. They discuss the threats of centralization happening to podcasting, not only from existing corporations such as Apple or Spotify but also Alphabet (by way of Youtube). Jones talks at length of updates to RSS that provide independent podcasters with features, such as soundbytes, transcripts, and payments. Jones talks at length about using blockchains for push notifications and for payments to independent podcasters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, Balkan uses an interesting metaphor: we are renting space on the corporate servers of Facebook et al. We pay our rent with our attention, privacy, and data. In contrast, we can and should own our own servers, much as we would our own homes. But unlike home ownership, running a server should be as easy as renting. This is thus an abstract for a design of self-hosting software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, an artist was unhappy with Tux being the Linux mascot and designed a fox named Xenia. 20 years later, someone rediscovers Xenia and draws her as a girl. The original artist noted Xenia was initially a boy, but that the transition makes sense in the light of trans Linux users. Xenia thus becomes not just a Linux mascot, but a trans rights in tech mascot.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s probably not surprising to hear that I needed to narrow that focus down. FOSS is a massive phenomenon, and any given area within it deserves lengthy analysis. For example, Biella Coleman’s classic book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.powells.com/book/coding-freedom-the-ethics-aesthetics-of-hacking-9780691144610&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coding Freedom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; focuses heavily on the Debian distribution. One could imagine similar books about the Linux Kernel, or Canonical, or Arch, or web servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given my background as a scholar, however, it makes sense that I should pursue a &lt;strong&gt;book-length project focusing on FOSS social media.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;beyond-corporate-social-media&quot;&gt;Beyond Corporate Social Media&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has read my previous scholarship knows I’ve been critical of corporate social media (e.g., Meta/Facebook/Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, Youtube) and what we once called “web 2.0” applications (e.g., Google search) since before it was cool. However, I have also consistently called for critics to explore alternatives to corporate media. In my view, it’s not enough to critique – we have to find ways forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been studying alternative social media for almost a decade now, and until recently it’s felt like a lonely field of research. After all, as loudly as I play the role of Old Man Shaking Fist at (the Corporate) Cloud, no one seemed to listen. Everyone is still using Facebook et al, despite years of emotional manipulation, whistleblowing, and data leaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, lately, the alternatives are getting a lot of attention. And it seems to be the wrong kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;alternative-social-media-becomes-alt-tech&quot;&gt;Alternative Social Media becomes Alt-Tech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of my concerns about corporate social media – namely, its power to manipulate what we see – seems to be shared by the alt-right. I’m talking, of course, of Gab.com and the forthcoming Trump social network, Truth. However, in many ways, the alt-tech social media platforms simply replicate many of the features of corporate social media (most notably centralization and monetization) while wallowing in hate speech and misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thus don’t see them as true alternatives. But what would make a true alternative? That, it seems to me, is the heart of this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;towards-ethical-citizens-social-media&quot;&gt;Towards Ethical, Citizens’ Social Media&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If alternative only means not-Facebook, it’s not really an alternative. And if alternative means “speak your mind, fascists!,” I’m not interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don’t have to flee from fascists into the cold bosom of Mark Zuckerberg just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are alternatives that not only help us get away from surveillance capitalism, but also actively push out fascists and hate-speech mongers. They aren’t just decentralized; they are &lt;em&gt;non&lt;/em&gt;-centralized. They can be run by any of us with the technical abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the people running them have values such as collective ownership, democratic control, and concern with environmental impact of media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And arising from these platforms are artists and creators who are helping imagine a better mediascape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These social media may well adhere to media scholar Clemencia Rodríguez’s call for “citizens’ media,” media that we not only participate in, but own and control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, a key example of this is Mastodon, the federated Twitter alternative. However, the fediverse is bigger than Mastodon, so I will have to explore systems such as PeerTube or Pixelfed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-about-foss&quot;&gt;What about FOSS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a big part of this equation is FOSS. Free and open source software provides a necessary – but not sufficient – ingredient. After all, Gab and Truth run on FOSS (specifically, forks of Mastodon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this book is going to be about FOSS alternative social media, and if I adhere to my critical orientation towards citizens’ media, then the book will have to explore how activists are taking FOSS and associating it with other elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I see it, the elements would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;political economy: how are these media governed? How are they paid for?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;environment: how are FOSS alternative operators addressing the environmental impact of networked media?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ethics: what sort of ethical standards do these systems adhere to?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cultural production: what forms of cultural production emerge from FOSS alternative social media?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;security: how do these media address security concerns? Not just cybersecurity, but insecurity arising from disinformation and manipulative communication?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;identity: how do these media map onto or influence how we conceive of ourselves?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;relation to other media: how do the FOSS alternatives relate to other media, such as corporate social media, broadcast media, or “alt-tech”?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-plan-of-the-book&quot;&gt;The Plan of the Book&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plan for the book, then, is to look at FOSS-based, ethical alternative social media through the above categorical lenses. I don’t imagine that each of the above points would be chapters, but any one of them or combinations of them might.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the points above are now tags in my Zotero library, allowing me to start sorting the materials into folders that might just give rise to chapters. I plan to blog about these categories here on FOSS Academic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also plan on publicly doing a lit review – offering thoughts on key texts that are relevant to the project. I mentioned Biella Coleman’s book &lt;em&gt;Coding Freedom&lt;/em&gt; above – that’s definitely on the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, watch this space as Goal 2 proceeds!&lt;/p&gt;

For a bit, I used Staticman, but that died for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, it hit me: so many sites use Facebook comments. Why can’t I use Mastodon, the FOSS alternative social media system, to do something similar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.xmgz.eu/jekyll-mastodon-comment/&quot;&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt; provided all the code I could need to do exactly that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is a test run. Feel free to comment on it using your Mastodon account. (I think other federated accounts might work, but not sure – if so, let me know in the comments!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have a Mastodon account, don’t worry! You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://joinmastodon.org&quot;&gt;sign up for an instance&lt;/a&gt; and join the federated fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;update-1&quot;&gt;UPDATE #1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tested it a bit and have found a few things that give me pause:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It does not respect the distinction between Unlisted and Public privacy settings. Both will show up here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; respect DM – that is, DMs do not show up as comments.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;It does not respect Content Warnings.&lt;/del&gt; This has been fixed; see Update #3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all that in mind, I think I may keep it (pending further testing) and include a warning in the “Comments” section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;update-2&quot;&gt;UPDATE #2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to another Mastodoner, I found that if anyone who uses Mastodon to comment on a blog post deletes said comment, then it will also no longer appear on the blog. I think that’s a cool feature, but I’m thinking that I have be &lt;em&gt;extremely clear&lt;/em&gt; about what happens when people comment on my blog. It’s going to be public – very public – not just in the federation, but also on my website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I’m not 100% certain this is wise. I’d love to get more opinions from Mastodon users. Feel free to leave them in the comments – or, to be certain that your opinion is expressed privately, DM me (@robertwgehl@scholar.social).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;update-3&quot;&gt;UPDATE #3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to keep pounding a drum few of us will hear, but &lt;strong&gt;Zotero&lt;/strong&gt; needs to be known about. Zotero, which is a bibliographic management system, released a beta of a new PDF reader and annotator which has greatly improved how I do academic research.&lt;/p&gt;

But I switched my main work laptop from Debian-based distros to Manjaro this year and have been so impressed. I didn’t realize what a relief it is not to have to worry about doing a massive upgrade – just keep rolling along instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;server&quot;&gt;Server&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use Ubuntu LTS servers for stability, so I probably have no business making this call. But I have been impressed by the organizational structure of &lt;strong&gt;AlmaLinux.&lt;/strong&gt; Every time I hear one of their representatives speak on podcasts, I can just hear their unwavering commitment to creating a community-owned enterprise Linux server distro. In fact, I think I need to study their structure a bit further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;desktop-environment&quot;&gt;Desktop Environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one won’t win, but I love &lt;strong&gt;MATE&lt;/strong&gt; and will defend it with crysknives. I’ve said it before, but when it comes to desktops, I’m a Linux Luddite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;largest-impact&quot;&gt;Largest impact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect Pipewire will win, but I think &lt;strong&gt;Wireguard&lt;/strong&gt; has been brilliant. I’ve used it extensively to create a virtual private network of devices, including Android phones, all using an installation of Pi-Hole to block unwanted traffic. In fact, right now I’m serving Jekyll from one machine over the local network to another via my Wireguard VPN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big, big benefit I’ve seen is countering some bad practices from my ISP: if I listen to internet radio streams on my regular connection, they are dropped after a few minutes. Run them through Wireguard and the streams will flow for days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;self-hosted-service&quot;&gt;Self-hosted service&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pi-hole.&lt;/strong&gt; Ad-blocking, local DNS, child-proofing my kid’s computer, blocking Facebook from my network… it’s all possible with Pi-Hole. Couple this with Wireguard and I can block ads on any connection, anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="Tuxies" /><category term="Goal 1" /><summary type="html">Linux Unplugged is at it again: it’s Tuxies time!

As I saw it, Mastodon’s swift action against the alt-right (specifically, their quick repudiation of Gab) was a very different approach than the corporate platform approach of Facebook and Twitter. Yes, the latter removed Trump. But they did so at a pretty convenient moment: after the election was over and the ad dollars were spent. Moreover, while banning Trump was a long-overdue move, it was clearly inadequate. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/22/jan-6-capitol-riot-facebook/&quot;&gt;As investigative journalism is revealing&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook in particular did little to quell the planning of the January 6 insurrection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I come again to praise Mastodon. This time, for quickly addressing the problem of Trump’s new platform, Truth, which appears to be a fork (or simply CTRL+F and replace) of Mastodon’s code. That in itself is not the issue – after all, Mastodon is FOSS, and people can therefore take it and use it. The issue is that Trump is claiming to &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/10/trumps-new-social-media-platform-found-using-mastodon-code/&quot;&gt;Mastodon’s response&lt;/a&gt; – as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2021/oct/21/trump-group-agplv3/&quot;&gt;that of the Software Freedom Conservancy&lt;/a&gt; – is to give Trump 30 days to quit claiming ownership of the code or be in violation of the license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my mind, this is like a powerful force hitting a very stupid object. It seems obvious that Trump will have to relinquish his claims that the code is proprietary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then again, Trump is notorious for doing things and then daring people to lawyer up, dragging his feet by using the courts. It’s clearly what he’s hoping to do with the January 6 investigation, and I wouldn’t be surprised if he does the same with Mastodon and the SFC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But those are Trump’s flaws.

&lt;p&gt;In the past, setting up meetings went a bit like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Them: Hey, can we meet? 
Me: Sure! When do you want to meet?
Them: I’m free Mondays and Fridays. 
Me: How about noon on Monday?
Them: Actually, I have an appointment them. What day of the week works for you?
Me: Wednesdays and Fridays.
Them: Great! What about 1 on Wednesday?
Me: Sure! 
Them: What timezone are you in?
Me: Central.
Them: Oh! Then 1 pm for you is 9 pm for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Etc, etc. Each of these being an email, of course, and usually with a delay of several hours between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they used to say in the commercials, “there’s got to be a better way!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nextcloud Appointments is that better way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appointments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creates a public form where would-be attendees can pick an open spot.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Those spots are based on pre-selected weekly times (e.g., my office hours).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;But! Appointments watches my other calendars for conflicts and blocks off those times from the public form.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And! Appointments also includes the option to embargo appointment spots in the next X hours (to prevent last-minute sign-ups).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This system has saved me a great deal of time. The back-and-forth of emails is no more. I share my public appointment link, people sign up, and they get contact info (for video chat or my office location). And Appointments works with timezones, so there’s no adjustment needed on either end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who fill out the form get an email, I get an email, and appointments adds the spot to my calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I droppped Ubuntu 18.04 for Manjaro (Mate, of course). And it’s going great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/manjaro.png&quot; alt=&quot;Manjaro Logo&quot; title=&quot;Manjaro&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manjaro feels a lot like Linux Mint back around 2010 – it’s detecting hardware (including hardware needing proprietary drivers) flawlessly. In fact, that was my biggest concern with the Dell computer I’m using. The day I got this computer it had Ubuntu 18.04 installed, which I was fine with. The first thing I did, however, broke the hardware support: I updated the computer. That’s it. &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt upgrade -y&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt; killed the sound and, very likely, the special power management firmware this Dell required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After working with Dell support, I got a particular Ubuntu image and got things running. However, I was always nervous that any upgrade would kill a lot of hardware. I even went so far as to stick with one kernel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I kept hearing about Manjaro – how they’re working on the PinePhone, how many people are running it, and how running an Arch-based distro means that there’s no need to do OS reinstallations. Given that Ubuntu 18.04 is showing its age, I tried running Manjaro off a USB drive on the laptop and… all good. So I took the plunge and installed Manjaro instead of Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Manjaro’s community version with MATE has gone pretty much seamlessly. I can still do the setup I prefer, with devilspie moving windows to workspaces, and all my favorite applications (Libreoffice, Zotero) are running great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, now I get to explore the world of pacman. I am really comfortable with apt, but pacman is just as easy to use, and I’m starting to see the appeal of having the latest versions of various software packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I’ve gone Manjaro Mental and put it on my son’s laptop and another computer, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have Ubuntu boxes – mainly as servers – so I don’t think I will ever leave Ubuntu behind, but for now I’m diggin’ Manjaro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I still know: I cannot truly say “I use Arch btw…”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="Manjaro" /><summary type="html">I made a change.

The Brave Browser is now &lt;a href=&quot;https://search.brave.com/&quot;&gt;offering a search engine&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://brave.com/brave-search-beta/&quot;&gt;their announcment&lt;/a&gt;, Brave Search promises “independent option for search which gives them unmatched privacy” and will use an independent index, rather than rely on Google or Microsoft. I’ve already started playing with Brave Search and am curious to see how it develops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, any time someone offers a search engine and their corporate parent isn’t named Alphabet, there’s a pretty predictable reaction: “Good on them for trying, but you just can’t beat Google.”  I’ve also heard academics say the same thing: “I can’t find anything without Google.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search is, of course, a very common approach to conducting research, and it’s especially important to my work on Internet cultures. One key way to study the Internet is by searching it. And it seems as though that means all my work ought to flow through Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t really thought much about this situation until just recently. Along with Sean Lawson, I co-authored a book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/social-engineering&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social Engineering: How Crowdmasters, Phreaks, Hackers, and Trolls Created a New Form of Manipulative Communication&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It will come out from MIT Press in a few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is the result of four years of research on hacker social engineering practices as well as early 20th century propaganda and public relations (a field that also referred to its activity as “social engineering”). After finishing this latest book, I realized I’m a living testament to the fact that yes, you can de-Google your search and still conduct research. Because that’s what I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/antiGoogle.png&quot; alt=&quot;Google logo with a line through it&quot; title=&quot;Google logo with a line through it&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how I conducted mostly de-Googled searches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;startpage&quot;&gt;Startpage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bulk of my research – especially my research on the history of hacker social engineers – relied on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.startpage.com&quot;&gt;Startpage&lt;/a&gt; searches, especially &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.startpage.com/en/advanced-search.html&quot;&gt;the advanced search features&lt;/a&gt;. I used those find obscure documents and websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, I can already hear many of you: “Startpage uses Google’s index!” Indeed, it does. One way to think of it is using Google through a proxy. But that’s not entirely the case. First of all, Startpage uses its own algorithms to sort Google’s index, so it differs in that regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But more importantly, Startpage does not customize search results based on my previous searches. I find that to be &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; important, because as a scholar focusing on the Internet cultures, I don’t want my previous search biases affecting what I find. I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to find unusual stuff that surprises me, not the most optimized result for me. I’m not looking for a donut shop near me that has the type of donuts I prefer; I’m looking for obscure text files, PDFs, and websites – things I haven’t found before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;archiveorg&quot;&gt;Archive.org&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org&quot;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt; is… I can’t think of good superlatives. Awesome? Invaluable? The coolest thing ever? In any case, all Internet Studies work should engage with the IA at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internet Archive has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protocol.com/internet-archive-preserving-future&quot;&gt;massive database&lt;/a&gt; – roughly 90 petabytes. Despite its size, the IA also offers its own search engine, mostly returning text-based results. Those results usually get me in the vicinity of what I’m looking for – often it’s a matter of searching within PDFs, which the IA also allows for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;worldcatorg&quot;&gt;Worldcat.org&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldcat.org&quot;&gt;Worldcat&lt;/a&gt; is a metasearch for holdings in libraries around the world. I often use it to get very good metadata on books for &lt;a href=&quot;https://zotero.org&quot;&gt;Zotero&lt;/a&gt;. Google Books and Amazon metadata are usually awful, missing fields like publisher, publisher city, and sometimes the author’s name. Worldcat, however, has been consistently good for metadata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But beyond that, Worldcat’s metasearch of libraries reveals a wealth of historical insight. Knowing the rhythm of book publications – for example, Walter Lippmann’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldcat.org/title/public-opinion/oclc/1252782253/editions?start_edition=261&amp;amp;sd=desc&amp;amp;referer=di&amp;amp;se=yr&amp;amp;editionsView=true&amp;amp;fq=&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Public Opinion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; appeared in 1922, and Edward Bernays’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldcat.org/title/crystallizing-public-opinion/oclc/226657356&amp;amp;referer=brief_results&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crystalizing Public Opinion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; appeared in 1923 – can tell me a lot about the “dialog” happening among authors. Plus, Worldcat also returns results for scholarly articles and other media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unfortunately-google-scholar&quot;&gt;Unfortunately: Google Scholar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said “mostly de-Googled,” and by that I did not mean the fact that Startpage uses Google’s index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, by that I mean that there’s no substitute for Google Scholar, and over the course of writing &lt;em&gt;Social Engineering,&lt;/em&gt; I relied on Google Scholar very heavily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am always watching for alternatives to Google Scholar, but they consistently come up short. I often use a vanity search for my own work to test a given database – mainly because I know what I’ve published over the years. Google Scholar finds my publications right away. &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.microsoft.com&quot;&gt;Microsoft’s academic search&lt;/a&gt; seems to miss quite a bit, though it’s better than it used to be. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scinapse.io&quot;&gt;Scinapse&lt;/a&gt; – who argues they’re “better than Google Scholar” – also fails to find many of my papers. I’m not sure what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.refseek.com&quot;&gt;Refseek&lt;/a&gt; is trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one I had high hopes for is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.base-search.net&quot;&gt;Bielefield Academic Search Engine&lt;/a&gt; (BASE), mainly because it is run by a university library (Bielefeld University Library). But the results there – for my admittedly vain search for my own work – is also underwhelming. I believe I can “claim” my profile and add papers manually, but who has time for that? After years of building profiles in Academia.edu, ResearchGate, or SSRN, I’m done with all that. I could spend my life building profiles of myself instead of, you know, &lt;em&gt;doing research.&lt;/em&gt; Instead, I just put my papers &lt;a href=&quot;https://robertwgehl.org/text/pubs/&quot;&gt;on my own website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upshot to Google Scholar is, for better or worse, it finds my papers automatically. And because of that, I’m pretty confident that I can find other people’s papers in Google Scholar – which is, of course, what I actually use it for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;keep-searching&quot;&gt;Keep Searching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there you have it. There is search beyond Google. It can be done. At the very least, thanks to Startpage, you don’t have to use Google proper – and this is not even to mention DuckDuckGo or, of course, Brave Search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, Google Scholar still seems indispensible, but I can even imagine doing a project without using Google Scholar, relying on a mix of Worldcat.org and maybe Microsoft Academic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have I missed anything? Any of you done research without having it flow through Google?

However, any time someone offers a search engine and their corporate parent isn’t named Alphabet, there’s a pretty predictable reaction: “Good on them for trying, but you just can’t beat Google.” I’ve also heard academics say the same thing: “I can’t find anything without Google.” Search is, of course, a very common approach to conducting research, and it’s especially important to my work on Internet cultures. One key way to study the Internet is by searching it. And it seems as though that means all my work ought to flow through Google. I hadn’t really thought much about this situation until just recently. Along with Sean Lawson, I co-authored a book, Social Engineering: How Crowdmasters, Phreaks, Hackers, and Trolls Created a New Form of Manipulative Communication. It will come out from MIT Press in a few months. The book is the result of four years of research on hacker social engineering practices as well as early 20th century propaganda and public relations (a field that also referred to its activity as “social engineering”). After finishing this latest book, I realized I’m a living testament to the fact that yes, you can de-Google your search and still conduct research. Because that’s what I did.</summary></entry></feed>
