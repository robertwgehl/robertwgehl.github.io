These are scheduled to be a part of the Zotero 6 release later this year, but when I heard about them, &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/03/19/cuttingZotero.html&quot;&gt;I installed the Zotero 5 developer version&lt;/a&gt; to give them a whirl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My quick take on the new features? They are now a key part of the FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-simple-pleasure-of-a-tab&quot;&gt;The Simple Pleasure of a Tab&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, opening a PDF in Zotero now opens its own native PDF reader with new annotation capabililties. I’ll get to that. But first, I did not realize how happy one tab could make me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PDF now opens in a new tab, where I can read it and take notes. What’s so cool about that is that I can easily go back to the main library and look at another source. I didn’t realize how often I did that, but it makes sense: the PDF I’m reading might make reference to another source, so I might want to go back to my library to see if I have it and cross-reference ideas. Or maybe I don’t have it – I can pop into Firefox and get it easily enough. All the while, the PDF tab is waiting there, patiently, for me to return to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can even open a second PDF in another tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/zoterotab.png&quot; alt=&quot;Zotero's new tab interface&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Zotero's new tab interface&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feature is great, and it makes me want more: could I eventually open search folders in a new tab? Group libraries? If so – managing my library will get so much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;taking-notes&quot;&gt;Taking Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for taking notes, the new PDF system offers a subtle, yet, invaluable capability: when I highlight text in the PDF, a button appears, allowing me to paste that highlighted section in a note. &lt;em&gt;And the pasted material doesn’t have carriage returns.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years now, I would copy and paste PDF text into a Zotero note and have to go through and delete carriage returns. It could take so long that often I would just re-type the text rather than copy and paste it. This new setup will save me a great deal of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s more – the pasted material has a citation at the end, allowing me an option to “Go To Page.” Clicking on that citation does what it says – it jumps to the page of the PDF. In addition, I tested this feature without a PDF open: clicking on it opens the PDF associated with the note in a new tab and jumps to the page. That’s a fantastic feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/zoteronote.png&quot; alt=&quot;Automatically generated citation in a Zotero note&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;An automatically generated citation in a Zotero note. Clicking on the citation allows you to go to that page in the PDF.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that would really make this feature sing is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I open a note and see a PDF citation, but the PDF in question is not open;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I click on the citation and click on”Go To Page”;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The PDF &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the corresponding note open in a new page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the new note feature, the PDF annotation system has PDF highlighting and sticky note capabilities. Both the highlights and sticky notes can easily be added to a separate note, as well. The sticky notes can be tagged. There’s a lot of new possibilities for library navigation now possible, thanks to tagging sticky notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, it looks like my location in a PDF was synced across devices. When I opened a PDF I was reading on a laptop at home on a second computer at work, I was dropped in exactly where I left off reading on the laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, these new features are so rich, I feel as though I’m barely scratching the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bugs&quot;&gt;Bugs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being beta software, I understand that there will be bugs. And there are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, the note window is pretty laggy. It often gets unresponsive while I’m typing. That can be frustrating – it reminds me of the early days when Zotero broke out of being a Firefox-only add-on and went “Standalone.” Zotero’s “snappiness” improved over time, and I imagine the same will happen here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, adding a chunk of text from the PDF to the note creats a new paragraph, rather than placing the text snippet on the current paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the cursor seems to get lost when navigating the note with the keypad, especially when the cursor traverses the citation field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;features-lost&quot;&gt;Features Lost&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there’s unfortunately a feature lost in notes: the new note system does not allow for HTML editing, nor does it currently have the old highlighting. Looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/88064/available-in-preview-zotero-pdf-reader-and-new-note-editor&quot;&gt;comments in the Zotero forum&lt;/a&gt;, HTML editing is not coming back, since the notes won’t use HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I put in a feature request, asking for a return of the highlighting option, and it sounds like the Zotero crew will implement that feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overall-take&quot;&gt;Overall Take&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the lagginess in note-taking, for anyone interested in these features but in the middle of important projects, I do recommend waiting until the Zotero 6 release. I’m in between projects, so lagginess in note-taking is not a big concern for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if history is any guide, the good people at Zotero will optimize these features for speed, and then this will be the biggest shift in how we interact with Zotero since it went “Standalone.” I’m already using these changes and benefiting from them, and I’m quite certain other academics will, too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="Zotero" /><category term="Goal 1" /><summary type="html">Zotero recently announced two major new features: an internal PDF reader and tab-based navigation.

&lt;p&gt;I just got done reading Sam Williams’s 2002 book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bookshop.org/books/free-as-in-freedom-paperback-richard-stallman-s-crusade-for-free-software/9781449324643&quot;&gt;Free As In Freedom: Richard Stallman’s Crusade for Free Software&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; I started reading it about March 15 or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, I thought of Stallman as largely in the background of the world of FOSS, since of course he resigned from the Free Software Foundation back in 2019. I knew that he was called out for some comments about Marvin Minsky and the Jeffrey Epstein case – comments that were, at best, tone-deaf and, at worst, apologies for the sexual predation of children. I also knew of increasing numbers of women who reported Stallman’s behavior made them uncomfortable and even unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/williams.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Cover of Williams's book Free as in Freedom, a biography of Richard Stallman&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The Cover of Williams's book Free as in Freedom, a biography of Richard Stallman&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But since I’m putting together Goal 2 – a book-length research project about FOSS – I figured that I need to engage with Stallman in some form, even if he was fading into the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Williams’s book caught my eye. As I read, I came across curious moments that may have appeared differently in 2002 than they do to this reader in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My intention was to read the book and post a bit about it here, as I did with &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/12/06/Dreaming-In-Code.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dreaming In Code&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as part of my larger research project into FOSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it turns out that I also finished the book in time for RM Mess 2.0. So this is changing from a book review into a post that connect Williams’s now two-decades old biography with a current event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content warnings: this post discusses sexual assault, child exploitation, and harassment. You might want to skip it on those grounds. Moreover, if you’re tired of discussions of Stallman, you also might want to skip this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;curious-moment-1-on-freedom-for-children&quot;&gt;Curious Moment #1: On “freedom” for children&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Williams writes about Stallman’s childhood, including his refusal to obey his mother. RMS would, for example, refuse to come to dinner and opt to read a book instead. As RMS recalls,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If I wanted to read, and my mother told me to go to the kitchen and eat or go to sleep, I wasn’t going to listen. I saw no reason why I couldn’t read. No reason why she should be able to tell me what to do, period. Essentially, what I had read about, ideas such as democracy and individual freedom, I applied to myself. I didn’t see any reason to exclude children from these principles” (page 27).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Williams goes on to note RMS refused to write term papers for his English classes, because freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RMS is, shall we say, notoriously consistent. His most notorious comment to date is likely the Marvin Minsky case, where he argues that Minsky’s sex with one of the children Epstein was grooming does not rise to the level of sexual assault:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We can imagine many scenarios, but the most plausible scenario is that she presented herself to him as entirely willing. Assuming she was being coerced by Epstein, he would have had every reason to tell her to conceal that from most of his associates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’ve concluded from various examples of accusation inflation that it is absolutely wrong to use the term “sexual assault” in an accusation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://selamjie.medium.com/remove-richard-stallman-fec6ec210794&quot;&gt;Selam G’s original Medium blog post&lt;/a&gt; presents the full RMS email and dissects its language much better than I will here. I simply want to flag a thread of logic used by RMS: freedom, apparently, includes the freedom of children to want sex with adults. Minsky’s fault, here, was not doing enough investigative work to find out if the victim was “truly” willing or serving in sexual servitude (as part of Epstein’s “harem,” to use RMS’s term). RMS is consistent with his previous position – children should be free to read what they wish. Children should be seen as willing sex partners. It’s not assault if the child is willing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISCLAIMER&lt;/strong&gt;: Before I go any further I need to clarify. &lt;strong&gt;I do not condone the sexual exploitation of children.&lt;/strong&gt; Moreover, being who I am (a middle-aged, straight, white man with a stable career), I struggle to understand the experiences of others, and my comments here cannot be considered a last word by any means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What follows, then, is my own analysis of the logic of RMS and how his consistent position on children’s “freedom” is a position that ultimately supports the privilege of exploiting children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of you may know I wrote a book about the Dark Web. Anyone who engages with the Dark Web has to deal with the stomach-turningly wretched specter of child expoitation. I studiously and carefully avoided child exploitation media during my research on the Dark Web, but I did engage in participant observation on Dark Web social media, and the topic often came up for debate. While there, I came across many people who would condemn child exploitation, but some who would apologize for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logic the child exploitation defenders used is exactly that of RMS: children should have rights!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This position is nothing more than an argument for guilt-free sexual objectification and exploitation of children. Basically, the apologists for Dark Web child exploitation argued that children should have the right to consent to sex with adults. Maybe children should have others rights, too, these people argued, but in the end it was always about reconceptualizing children as willing participants in adults’ sexual pleasure. That was basically the end goal of the argument for the freedom of children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RMS’s trajectory here – the 2002 interview with Williams, comments in an email thread about Epstein and Minsky – replicate this telos almost exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is a major gap between RMS’s precocious childhood refusal to write term papers or eat his supper and his defense of Minsky. It is a gap that exposes so many problems with RMS’s “freedom.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partly, it’s a gap that includes a spectrum of freedom for children. Perhaps RMS has made calls for the rights of children beyond being their ability to refuse dinner or consent to sex with adults. Maybe he’s argued for voting rights, for example. But what has been documented, however, are his other, &lt;a href=&quot;https://rms-open-letter.github.io/appendix&quot;&gt;similar comments invoking of “willingness” and “consent”&lt;/a&gt; of children for sex. This echoes the logic found among the stunted political philosophies of Dark Web child exploitation advocates: “child rights” only means “adult rights to sexualize children.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the gap also includes the range of human experiences beyond those of a privileged man who went to private schools and was destined for Harvard. It’s perhaps easy for a man to conclude, based on his relatively privileged position, that his freedom as a boy to not go to bed should be analogous to the “freedom” of a young girl to go to bed with a much older adult. But that’s a leap in logic that completely ignores the whole host of human experiences – including class, race, gender, sexual identity – that complicates RMS’s radically reductive syllogism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How could, for example, a young Black woman make an argument that she shouldn’t do her term papers? Can she still get into Harvard, as RMS did, despite not doing her school work? Can she live – sleep, eat, and presumably bathe – in safety in a computer lab at MIT, as RMS did?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should she make the same conclusions about freedom?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Condemning RMS for the Minsky comments was absolutely correct, and I see no reason to relent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;curious-moments-2-affection-for-women-in-tech&quot;&gt;Curious Moment(s) #2: Affection for women in tech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than a single moment, this is more of a thread throughout Williams’s book, something impossible to miss post-2019. At one point, during lunch, Williams brings up something he’s observed RMS do with women he meets: he kisses their hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Yes, I do do that,” Stallman says. “I’ve found it’s a way of offering some affection that a lot of women will enjoy. It’s a chance to give some affection and to be appreciated for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, at another meal with RMS, RMS’s girlfriend, and Williams’s wife, Williams notes RMS engaging in more flirtation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although more flirtatious than I remembered – a flirtatiousness spoiled somewhat by the number of times Stallman’s eyes fixated on my wife’s chest – Stallman retained the same general level of prickliness (page 198).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, this comment about chest-fixation is excised from &lt;a href=&quot;https://sagitter.fedorapeople.org/faif-2.0.pdf&quot;&gt;Version 2.0 of the book&lt;/a&gt; – a version RMS himself edited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Minsky comments are presented as the proximate cause of RMS’s ouster, reports of RMS’s behavior towards women have contributed, as well. Selam G’s original post &lt;a href=&quot;https://selamjie.medium.com/remove-richard-stallman-appendix-a-a7e41e784f88&quot;&gt;led to women coming forward to explain the ways in which RMS made them uncomfortable or even unsafe at MIT&lt;/a&gt;. These women join women who made similar observations about their experiences at MIT – &lt;a href=&quot;https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~lazowska/mit/Images/Chapter2.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;back in 1983&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These women are citing their experiences at MIT or working in the tech sector. I myself work at a tech school. This week, I will teach a class on professional identity, and to prime the conversation, the class is reading Deneen Hatmaker’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-0432.2012.00589.x&quot;&gt;article on the problems women face in engineering&lt;/a&gt;. That article is a decade old. Its themes are the same as the MIT report from 4 decades ago. Despite the age of the article, or the revelations from that 1983 report, my students &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; are saying the same thing about contemporary engineering and tech fields: they experience or have witnessed the lack of acceptance – and outright harassment – of women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The call for someone like RMS to step aside is justified precisely because his presence is clearly hindering the professional, intellectual, and personal development of so many people – including people who could be otherwise, you know, making free software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;curious-moment-3-rage&quot;&gt;Curious Moment #3: Rage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other curious moment isn’t so curious. It’s pure Stallman. Chapter 12 of Williams’s book, “A Brief Journey Through Hacker Hell,” documents RMS’s growing rage during a drive. RMS is driving a car (with Williams along for the ride) and a friend is in a car ahead of him, leading him through a town in Hawaii to a dinner appointment. Stallman is enraged because the other driver is taking a street instead of a highway. His rage grows, and grows, until, as Williams reports, he’s flailing against the steering wheel and screaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t really have to say much more than this – the #1 cited reason why people don’t like Stallman is his, as Williams puts it charitably, “prickliness.” Others might characterize it as belligerence and anger. The targets of his rage include enemies of freedom, but also fellow travelers and erstwhile friends – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jskq3-lpQnE&quot;&gt;even people who invite him to speak&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are moments when principles matter, and of course with things like licenses, words matter. I am too young to have witnessed the “Free Software” versus “Open Source” debates, but I do understand the distinction, and I understand calls for terms like “&lt;a href=&quot;https://communalsoftware.codeberg.page/&quot;&gt;Communal Software&lt;/a&gt;” as a means to clarify what software should be used for. I understand the politics of names and labels and theoretical concepts quite well, and how the free labor of people can not only provide valuable resources to those who wouldn’t afford them – like the FOSS I came to as a grad student – but also &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.facebook.com/&quot;&gt;provide a “competitive advantage” to massive corporations making our current digital dystopia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, raging at allies for making mistakes or saying something “wrong” is not building a movement. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://p1k3.com/2019/10/20/&quot;&gt;this post argues&lt;/a&gt;, the problems we face are bigger than interjecting a word and a slash into the conversation: “Free software isn’t whatever RMS says it is. Free software is what we make of it: We who want to be free, we who want others to be free.” So we need to move past RMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, the call for RMS to step aside helps grow the movement, not hobble it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rm-mess-redux&quot;&gt;RM Mess, Redux&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, I started reading Williams’s book &lt;em&gt;Free As In Freedom&lt;/em&gt; around March 15, 2021, a time when RMS was not involved in the FSF. I finished it on March 21. I planned on writing down notes and moving on to other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I woke up on the 22nd to &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.itsfoss.com/richard-stallman-is-back-at-fsf/&quot;&gt;the news that RMS is back&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am now waking up every morning to news that people aren’t letting this slide. To date, I’ve seen condemnations of RMS’s return to the Free Software Foundation from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/statement-re-election-richard-stallman-fsf-board&quot;&gt;The Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mozilla/status/1374513444838199304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;The Mozilla Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Tor Project&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-statement-about-richard-stallmans-return-free-software-foundation-board&quot;&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and more (having trouble keeping up).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, these organizations (and, I imagine, this blog post) will be condemned as the fevered reactions of froth-mouthed “cancel mobs.” Indeed, Abhishek of It’s FOSS is using &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.itsfoss.com/richard-stallman-is-back-at-fsf/&quot;&gt;that language&lt;/a&gt;, as are commenters on Slashdot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I wonder: how much evidence does anyone need before they are willing to accept that RMS is toxic and FOSS ought to move on? The evidence was there in Williams’s book two decades ago. The evidence was in the MIT CS report four decades ago. The evidence is piling up in front of you now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free as in freedom may require being freed of the “founder” of Freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-williamss-book&quot;&gt;On Williams’s Book&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lost in all this is any assessment of Williams’s book itself. It’s hard to judge &lt;em&gt;Free As In Freedom&lt;/em&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get the sense, reading it, that Williams was treading lightly, but in the end – especially in his epilogue – he started to get weary of his subject. I’m reading this from a strange perspective, but I can’t help but feel that Williams was trying to warn us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="Stallman" /><category term="Free Software Foundation" /><category term="Goal 2" /><category term="FOSS Library" /><summary type="html">I guess I have strange timing.

Moreover, if you’re tired of discussions of Stallman, you also might want to skip this post.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Cutting-Edge Zotero</title><link href="https://fossacademic.tech/2021/03/19/cuttingZotero.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Cutting-Edge Zotero" /><published>2021-03-19T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-03-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://fossacademic.tech/2021/03/19/cuttingZotero</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://fossacademic.tech/2021/03/19/cuttingZotero.html">&lt;p&gt;There’s exciting news on the Zotero front!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zotero just announced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zotero.org/support/pdf_reader_preview&quot;&gt;preview of their new tab system, complete with a built-in PDF reader&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone living the FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream, this is huge news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/zotero.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Zotero Logo&quot; title=&quot;The Zotero Logo&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The Zotero logo is in the public domain.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They plan on releasing these features to the public in Version 6, but anyone itching to try it can use the development version of Zotero. This post will discuss how to install Zotero’s beta in Ubuntu Mate 18.04, though the approach should be similar for other Linux distros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;NB: Note, I would have found this sooner or later, but credit to Sean Lawson for alerting me!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1-shut-zotero-down-and-back-it-up&quot;&gt;Step 1: Shut Zotero Down and Back It Up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, make sure you’re not running Zotero. You can still have your browser open, however – the Zotero plugin will not affect this step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After shutting down, navigate to your Zotero profile folder. You should see a zotero.sqlite file. Because switching to the Zotero Beta could cause irreversible changes to this database, it’s best to back it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/zoterosqlite.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of the Zotero folder and zotero.sqlite file&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The Zotero folder and zotero.sqlite file in Caja, Mate's file browser&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also backed up my installation of Zotero’s program files. Out of habit, I put them in a folder called “zoteroStandalone” in /.local/share. I simply created an archive of that folder and then deleted its contents. This is going to be my target for the Beta version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-2-get-the-beta&quot;&gt;Step 2: Get the Beta&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then downloaded the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zotero.org/support/dev_builds&quot;&gt;beta version of Zotero&lt;/a&gt; from their Dev Builds page. It’s in a compressed archive. I unpacked the archive in my now-empty /.local/share/zoteroStandalone folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/zoterostandalonebackup.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of my .local/share folder with zoteroStandalone's directory in it&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;I store Zotero's executable files in /.local/share/zoteroStandalone&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, since I’ve been using Zotero for a while, I could then just launch Zotero from Mate’s Brisk menu and it was up and running. But, in case any of you want to know how to add Zotero to your menu, see the next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;optional-step-add-to-the-brisk-menu&quot;&gt;Optional Step: Add to the Brisk Menu&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add Zotero to Mate’s Brisk menu, right-click on your menu and choose “Edit Menus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to add Zotero to the “Office” subcategory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/briskmenu.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of Mate's Brisk menu editor&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Brisk Menu editing starts with selecting where you want to add your menu items.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, select “Add Item.” You will see a menu like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/addingmenuitem.png&quot; alt=&quot;Adding an individual item to the Brisk menu&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I stored Zotero in my /.local/share folder, the command path is /home/robert/.local/share/zoteroStandalone/zotero. To add an icon, I click on that springy Mario Brothers-looking icon and navigate to /home/robert/.local/share/zoteroStandalone/chrome/icons/default/default256.png.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I can launch Zotero from the menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve done all this and installed the Zotero beta, perhaps you’re as curious as I am about the new tabbed interface and PDF reader. To get those features, you have to opt-in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/betaoptin.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of Zotero's general preferences menu&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Here is where you turn on magic things.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do that, go to Edit -&amp;gt; Preferences and use the General Tab. There’s an option about halfway down the menu to opt in. After a restart, Zotero will have the new features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just did this process minutes ago, so expect a follow-up post on using the new features soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ok! If you had a good budget to build a cloud infrastructure to support small teams (2-5 people) collaborating on projects, with a special focus on academic writing projects, what would you recommend?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I’m thinking Linux-based cloud stuff, so I have in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Nextcloud&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Jitsi&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Matrix&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;and…? Any recommendations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked this question in all seriousness. I am lucky enough to have a small amount of research funding, I want to promote the world of software beyond Google and Microsoft, and so I’m really keen on building a FOSS Academic Laboratory in the cloud and using to for any collaborative projects I’m a part of. After all, it’s my &lt;a href=&quot;/about.html&quot;&gt;Goal #1&lt;/a&gt;: to use FOSS for as much of my academic work as is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/penquinquestions.png&quot; alt=&quot;A penguin with question marks above its head&quot; style=&quot;width: 50%&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;This penguin's got questions.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The response I got to the questions was &lt;em&gt;freakin’ awesome!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought it would be a good idea to catalog it here. I’ll start with the least-recommended things and work my way up to the most-recommended. That’s not to say this is a ranking – things mentioned only once might be really valuable. I’m really just noting what was mentioned most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll also note which ones I am considering deploying – again, this is not a commentary on the quality of any of these systems. It’s more related to my own specific use cases forged in the past decade of academic collaborations.
&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fidus-writer&quot;&gt;Fidus Writer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one I hadn’t heard of. Per their website, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fiduswriter.org/how-it-works/&quot;&gt;Fidus Writer&lt;/a&gt; is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;an online collaborative editor especially made for academics who need to use citations and/or formulas. The editor focuses on the content rather than the layout, so that with the same text, you can later on publish it in multiple ways: On a website, as a printed book, or as an ebook. In each case, you can choose from a number of layouts that are adequate for the medium of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds intriguing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it looks like its Zotero support is limited to drag-and-drop. I’d definitely want something closer to LibreOffice’s level of Zotero integration (cite while you write, editing citations, etc). But Fidus looks like it’s developing quickly, so it may be one to watch, especially since it puts collaboration first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pubpub&quot;&gt;PubPub&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pubpub.org/about&quot;&gt;PubPub&lt;/a&gt; is a means to publish academic work online and to continue the iterative editing of it even after publication. It solves a problem – after publication, I might find a mistake in my work, or want to update it, or to allow someone else to build on it. But I have no real way of doing that. PubPub solves that problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen books published in this manner, and I always value the easy access to them. I don’t have as much experience with giving or receiving feedback in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may be a bit of FOSS to explore later on – perhaps as a way to share my work outside of normal publishing channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;Latex&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several in the thread made recommendations for LaTex collaborative systems, citing ShareLatex and Overleaf. Looks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sharelatex.com/&quot;&gt;the two are one and the same now&lt;/a&gt;, having joined forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a thing to confess: I’ve never used LaTex, and I haven’t worked with anyone who has, either. So I’m going to note these for the record, but I can’t say too much about them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;homebase&quot;&gt;Homebase&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One person mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;https://joinhomebase.com/&quot;&gt;HomeBase&lt;/a&gt;. At first glance, this may seem odd, since it’s geared towards small businesses. But it’s really a suite of team collaboration applications, like scheduling and time tracking, group chats, and tools for “onboarding.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could actually see using something like this if I needed to hire student assistants, assuming my university’s HR does not require me to use the university’s HR system. In my experience I’ve seen both with student workers – “do it yourself” contracts and hiring procedures and university-mandated HR systems. I prefer the latter for legal reasons, but if I had to do it on my own, HomeBase might solve that problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jupyter&quot;&gt;Jupyter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For collaborative code writing and notetaking, there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://jupyter.org/&quot;&gt;Jupyter&lt;/a&gt;. Per their website, “The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not often a pressing need for the work I do, which is mainly interpretive, humanities work. However, my research area of interest is Internet cultures, broadly speaking, and I have had to come up with or modify web scraping scripts in Python. I could easily see collaborating with someone to build such scripts. Maybe Jupyter is too powerful for that, but if the need arises, I would take a look at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;writefreely&quot;&gt;WriteFreely&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://writefreely.org/&quot;&gt;WriteFreely&lt;/a&gt; is something I keep hearing about, which is not surprising since I spend so much time on Mastodon! It’s a minimalistic blogging platform that integrates well with ActivityPub, allowing people in the fediverse to follow and share one’s posts. It’s meant to be so light it could run on a Raspberry Pi, which is a great feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could see integrating this into a project, since many of my projects have a public-facing, blogging component. I’m definitely considering this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bookstack&quot;&gt;BookStack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bookstackapp.com/&quot;&gt;BookStack&lt;/a&gt; is a self-hosted wiki system. Similar to what I said about WriteFreely, this could underpin the public-facing part of any given project. There are times when the presentation of information calls for blogs, and there are times when a wiki is a good way to go. I only ever thought of MediaWiki as a solution, but BookStack looks like it has a lighter server footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rocketchat-or-mattermost&quot;&gt;Rocket.chat or Mattermost&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rocket.chat/&quot;&gt;Rocket.chat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://mattermost.com/&quot;&gt;Mattermost&lt;/a&gt; were cited as alternatives to Slack.  Of the two, Mattermost is touting its security aspects, which is always a good emphasis. This is especially the case for academics dealing with sensitve data (interviews, HIPAA-protected data, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I’ve not really used Slack, so I’m not sure what I’m missing in that regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;arkisto&quot;&gt;Arkisto&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arkisto-platform.github.io/&quot;&gt;Arkisto&lt;/a&gt; is meant for data management, particularly at the end of research projects. As the website says, “The basis of Arkisto is that the long-term preservability of well-described data is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; the first consideration.” It looks to me as if they’re thinking long-term about storing data for future use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sort of work I do may not fit what they have in mind. If I gather, for example, ethnographic data from participant observation (such as I did for my book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/weaving-dark-web&quot;&gt;Weaving the Dark Web&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;, I actually destroy the data after a period of time to protect people’s privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my other work, the data I rely on is bibliographic – I collect sources and interpret them in a more humanistic/historical approach. To have that data live on, I’m hoping that using &lt;a href=&quot;https://zotero.org&quot;&gt;Zotero&lt;/a&gt; creates the necessary metadata (let me know if I’m wrong.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, I sometimes get invited to join teams working with data in the way Arkisto envisions. Thinking long-term about such data as a public good is a laudable goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jitsi&quot;&gt;Jitsi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several people agreed with my interest in &lt;a href=&quot;https://jitsi.org/&quot;&gt;Jitsi&lt;/a&gt;, the self-hosted video conferencing system. I am strongly inclined to try it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried it in mid-2020 and experienced glitches. I was very keen on getting it working, though, because I was (and remain) opposed to the sudden explosion of Zoom use. Jitsi struck me as a potentially easy alternative for students to talk to me. I had trouble running it, but a few months is a long time where well-maintained FOSS projects are concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;xmpp-based-solutions&quot;&gt;XMPP-Based Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xmpp.org/&quot;&gt;XMPP&lt;/a&gt;. I think I heard of that once upon a time! In all seriousness, I was once an avid &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pidgin.im/&quot;&gt;Pidgin&lt;/a&gt; user (with OTR encryption, of course). I went away from it, for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But XMPP is making a comeback, not just for me, but for many people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://pleroma.social/&quot;&gt;Pleroma&lt;/a&gt;, a federated server that can connect to Mastodon, Pixelfed, and other projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I could see, no one in the thread mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;https://movim.eu/&quot;&gt;Movim&lt;/a&gt;, an XMPP-based federated social networking system getting a lot of attention these days, but I’m pretty sure someone will mention it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m starting to lean towards installing one of these, at the very least to experiment with them and see where they take me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;matrix&quot;&gt;Matrix&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matrix was mentioned a great deal, but people were less supportive of this option. Instead, they pointed to other ways to chat. I was surprised by this – some of the Linux podcasts I listen to are all-in on &lt;a href=&quot;https://matrix.org/&quot;&gt;Matrix’s Synapse&lt;/a&gt;, so I figured it was a necessity. But, maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to set that one aside to reduce my workload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nextcloud&quot;&gt;Nextcloud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly everyone agreed on &lt;a href=&quot;https://nextcloud.com&quot;&gt;Nextcloud&lt;/a&gt;. It would end up being the beating heart of a collaborative academic cloud setup. It has file version control and file sharing. And I could easily add calendars and task lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tend to agree: I have a small Nextcloud server of my own, and I collaborated with a colleague on a book project using it. While the project went smoothly, there were a couple times the version control of Nextcloud saved us from losing work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/nextcloud.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Nextcloud Logo&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The Nextcloud Logo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that collaborative project, we mainly used &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org/en/&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/a&gt; for chatting, mostly via or text and on occasion via voice. Signal worked fine, but I would like something more persistent to keep track of ideas (for privacy, we set our Signals to delete after a set period.) This is why I mentioned something like Matrix or Jitsi in my initial post. One person noted that Jitsi or Matrix would not even be necessary, thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://nextcloud.com/talk/&quot;&gt;Nextcloud’s text and video chat support&lt;/a&gt;. Another disagreed, essentially, arguing that people are by now used to the capabilities of a Jitsi-like video conferencing application. In any case, Nextcloud is a possible chat channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several pointed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collaboraoffice.com/&quot;&gt;Collabora&lt;/a&gt;, the system that allows for collaborative editing of Libreoffice docs (in a manner similar to Google Docs.) Assuming Collabora supports &lt;a href=&quot;https://zotero.org&quot;&gt;Zotero&lt;/a&gt; as well as client-side Libreoffice does, it seems like a no-brainer to add to the mix. The book project I just completed did not use Collabora, instead passing ODTs back and forth, so I’m curious to see how well Collabora could work in a future project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add it all up and Nextcloud is the single most important app in the stack, so I’m definitely going to fire it up. I may see if I can use it for all the things – invest in a more powerful server with a good amount of storage, rather than multiple VMs. It may be easier to administer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks like Nextcloud is definitely in the future, and Jitsi &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be. Something federated and XMPP-based might be, as well. The others are good to keep in mind for more specialized use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nextcloud gets the nod simply because it could cover all the bases, so administering would be easier – that’s a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final thought, but an important one. I did not ask specifically about security. If anyone has recommendations there, I’m all ears. I know that I’d want to use SSH keys for server administration, two-factor authentication on both my hosting provider and Nextcloud, and insiste on 2FA for any collaborators. Beyond that, any tips out there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone who offered suggestions!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="Goal 1" /><summary type="html">I posted a question to Mastodon (specifically, scholar.social): Ok! If you had a good budget to build a cloud infrastructure to support small teams (2-5 people) collaborating on projects, with a special focus on academic writing projects, what would you recommend? I’m thinking Linux-based cloud stuff, so I have in mind: Nextcloud Jitsi Matrix and…? Any recommendations? I asked this question in all seriousness. I am lucky enough to have a small amount of research funding, I want to promote the world of software beyond Google and Microsoft, and so I’m really keen on building a FOSS Academic Laboratory in the cloud and using to for any collaborative projects I’m a part of. After all, it’s my Goal #1: to use FOSS for as much of my academic work as is possible. This penguin's got questions. The response I got to the questions was freakin’ awesome! I thought it would be a good idea to catalog it here. I’ll start with the least-recommended things and work my way up to the most-recommended. That’s not to say this is a ranking – things mentioned only once might be really valuable. I’m really just noting what was mentioned most. I’ll also note which ones I am considering deploying – again, this is not a commentary on the quality of any of these systems. It’s more related to my own specific use cases forged in the past decade of academic collaborations.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Staticman Comments Test Post</title><link href="https://fossacademic.tech/2021/01/24/Staticman.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Staticman Comments Test Post" /><published>2021-01-24T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2021-01-24T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://fossacademic.tech/2021/01/24/Staticman</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://fossacademic.tech/2021/01/24/Staticman.html">&lt;p&gt;This post is to test &lt;a href=&quot;https://staticman.net/&quot;&gt;Staticman&lt;/a&gt; comments.

&lt;p&gt;I’m basing this process of this &lt;a href=&quot;https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2020/02/05/now-with-comments.html&quot;&gt;helpful blog post&lt;/a&gt; from Travis Downs of Performance Matters. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 1: There are clearly problems in my configuration, and so I must keep debugging. But it’s time for a walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 2: Success in posting a comment after turning ReCaptcha off. However, not sure if I set things up to &lt;em&gt;display&lt;/em&gt; the comment…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 3: Success in getting a comment posted! But the workflow is very convoluted. I know Staticman uses Github pull requests to work, so I have to merge each comment. That’s fine. However, after I do so, I will have to move the data from my local version of my static site and then rebuild it via Jekyll. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INX-KrjaNOo&quot;&gt;There has to be a better way&lt;/a&gt;! And I will figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, I do know I will have to style the comments, as well. One thing at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 4: I think it’s done! Comment forms are styled for desktop and mobile, and the workflow is now improved. I initially set up my Github repository to be only the contents of the _site folder, but now the whole thing (warts and all) is in Github, which makes moderating comments much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, thanks go to Travis Downs for his exhaustive post on how to get Staticman going, as well as some of his code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have a few more tweaks – most notably, to de-Google-ify the whole thing, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwZwkk7q25I&quot;&gt;system is not down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>RWG</name></author><category term="Staticman" /><summary type="html">This post is to test Staticman comments.
