      <p>One major goal for my Goal 2 book project is to learn from people who create things on the fediverse. They might create code and cultures by developing and running instances. Or, they might be using the fediverse to promote their <a href="https://pixelfed.social/">photography</a>, <a href="https://funkwhale.audio/">music</a>, or <a href="https://writefreely.org/">ideas</a>.</p>

<p>As an endowed research chair, I have the privilege of <a href="http://www.regents.la.gov/assets/docs/2013/05/BoRSF_Endowed_Prof_Policy_Rev_10-12.pdf">generous research funding</a>. For the purposes of my book project, research includes talking to people, running my own digital infrastructure (e.g., the incredible Nextcloud), and, of course, studying texts.</p>

<p>The meaning of “texts” is quite open-ended. Obviously, I’m reading books and journal articles. But so, so much knowledge is being created on the Fediverse itself – including knowledge offered only to subscribers. There are artists, musicians, and writers using Patreon (or, maybe better, <a href="https://liberapay.com/">Liberapay</a>) to share their work with subscribers.</p>

<p>Do the math, Robert.</p>

      <p>This month’s FOSS finds: I was listening to NPR (which makes sense since I drive an electric car and I am a communist) and StoryCorps came on. I usually hear it while dropping my kid off at school, and it’s always a conversation-starter between us. It has been for years. Which got me to thinking: the StoryCorps project must have <em>a lot</em> of archived recordings of their oral history.</p>

<p>Indeed, they do. They’ve been doing oral history for 20 years now.</p>

<p>Which got me to thinking: if StoryCorps has been around for 20 years, they must have done an interview or two about FOSS.</p>

<p>Indeed, they have.</p>

<p>So the FOSS find this time are a few citations of those interviews. I haven’t had a chance to listen to them yet, so these abstracts will be from the StoryCorps site. I will listen to them soon, because I wonder if they can supplement my Goal 2 book project research. I’m <a href="/2022/04/17/InterviewWorkflow.html">conducting interviews of my own</a>, but the more voices, the better, yeah?</p>

<p>Read on to see the ones I found in a few minutes of searching. Feel free to suggest more such interviews!</p>

      <p>With my <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/social-engineering">last book</a> wrapped up, I am now hard at work building the next book, which is the Goal 2 of this blog. (Goal 1, recall, is writing about being a FOSS academic. Goal 2 is writing a book about FOSS). My new book project will focus on what I’m calling <a href="https://fossacademic.tech/2022/01/06/Goal2.html">“ethical source alternative social media”</a> – social media that allows ordinary people to be in control, that uses moderation for social, economic, and environmental justice and not to support oppression, and that runs on FOSS.</p>

<p>Methodologically, this project will demand I use my expertise in software studies, science and technology studies, and critical communication studies to analyze code, protocols, and network structures. But I also want to use participant observation and interviewing. And, I want this to adhere to the highest ethical standands as well as use FOSS technologies throughout.</p>

<p>I want to include the voices of ethical ASM members, developers, and admins. It may be tempting to do what a lot of people seem to have done and quote fediverse posts. However, I’ve observed that many, many fediverse users do not consent to having their posts taken out of context. There are public forums I can quote – for example, the <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/discussions">Github issues forum for Mastodon</a>. But I think the best vehicle to hear people talk about their experience with ethical ASM is via interviewing.</p>

<p>In this post I will briefly describe how I will manage interviewing. I hope this resource is useful not just to other researchers, but also to anyone considering being interviewed by me who might be curious about my process.</p>

      <h2 class="postHeader"><a href="/2022/03/26/NewBookOldBook.html">New Book, Old Book</a></h2>
      <p>I’ve not written much about my most recent book, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/social-engineering">Social Engineering</a> (MIT Press, 2022) on this blog. It didn’t seem like a good topic for this FOSS-centric blog. When I did write about it, I focused on the fact that my co-author, Sean Lawson, and I were able to use FOSS (particularly Nextcloud) to write it. In the parlance of this blog, that’s a decidedly Goal 1 topic – about using FOSS tools to do academic work.</p>

<p>So, I’ve focused instead on my next project, the Goal 2 project of writing a book about FOSS alternative social media. My idea is to use this blog to publicly write that book. Such public writing is new to me – it’s even a bit intimidating – but seems appropriate for this topic.</p>

<p>But the more I’m digging into what it means to envision, make, and realize ethical, FOSS, alternative social media, the more I realize my latest book, <em>Social Engineering,</em> is directly relevant to the project. So, this post is a way for me to make those connections.</p>

      <p>This week’s FOSS finds: The big news – or maybe non-news – in this space is the pathetically inept rollout of Truth Social, Donald Trump’s $1,000,000,000 social networking site built on the free-as-in-beer but also free-as-in-freedom Mastodon software base. I watched Truth go online and I have thoughts, but here I will just share some resources I’ve gathered.</p>

      <p>As part of Goal 2 of this blog, I’m writing a book about FOSS, specifically FOSS alternative social media. Like any good academic, I need to review the literature. I want to do so a bit more publicly than I have in the past – hence this blog.</p>

<p>In fact, I’ve already started the process a bit: early on this blog went a bit viral <a href="2020/12/06/Dreaming-In-Code.html">thanks to my post about Scott Rosenberg’s <em>Dreaming in Code.</em></a>, which was linked by Hacker News. I also wrote <a href="2021/03/28/RMMess.html">a review of sorts of Sam Williams’s <em>Free as in Freedom,</em></a> a biography of Stallman. I just so happened to finish reading that book when Stallman was reinstated to the FSF, which made my post a bit more polemical than review.</p>

<p>This time, I’m going to turn to a modern classic: Gabriella Coleman’s <em>Coding Freedom: The Ethics and Aesthetics of Hacking.</em></p>

      <h2 class="postHeader"><a href="/2022/02/03/Zettlr.html">I Have Settled on Zettlr</a></h2>
      <p>About a week ago, I took to my home Mastodon instance, scholar.social, and asked whether people preferred <a href="https://www.zettlr.com/">Zettlr</a> or <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>. Both are Markdown editors which also provide valuable features on top, including linking together Markdown notes and varying degrees of Zotero support.</p>

<p>I asked because I’m using Markdown more and more. I use it regularly to plan my weeks, I obviously use it for this blog (which is a static Jekyll site), and I started using it to jot down ideas in a journaling program called <a href="https://rednotebook.sourceforge.io/">RedNoteBook</a>. I was hoping to streamline blogging, note-taking, and other Markdown tasks in one system.</p>

<p>So, I have tried both Zettlr and Obsidian – and I also tried a third system, <a href="https://logseq.com/">Logseq</a> – and have decided to adopt Zettlr. It meets my needs quite well, which are probably a bit more minimal than people might expect.</p>

<p>However, given what these projects are doing, I do not feel locked into my choice. In fact, I have all three installed and may hop between them.</p>

      <p>I recently announced my <a href="2022/01/06/Goal2.html">new book project</a>, focusing on ethical FOSS social media, and I’m trying an experiment in writing it openly. That’s Goal 2 of this blog (Goal 1 being discussions of my actually using FOSS to complete this task). To that end, I’ve decided to share items I’ve found as I do my research.</p>

<p>I’m calling it FOSS Finds, because alliteration.</p>

<p>These are typically going to be websites, blogposts, podcasts, or academic research. They may or may not be very recent. I plan on including a citation (exported, of course, from Zotero) and a brief note about each, a la an annotated bibliography, and versions of my Zotero tags. The notes won’t be exhaustive – it’s really about what I’m collecting at this stage, rather than analysis.</p>

      <p>For about a year I’ve been teasing at Goal 2 for this blog, which is to write a book about FOSS. It’s probably not surprising to hear that I needed to narrow that focus down. FOSS is a massive phenomenon, and any given area within it deserves lengthy analysis. For example, Biella Coleman’s classic book <a href="https://www.powells.com/book/coding-freedom-the-ethics-aesthetics-of-hacking-9780691144610"><em>Coding Freedom</em></a> focuses heavily on the Debian distribution. One could imagine similar books about the Linux Kernel, or Canonical, or Arch, or web servers.</p>

<p>Given my background as a scholar, however, it makes sense that I should pursue a <strong>book-length project focusing on FOSS social media.</strong></p>

      <h2 class="postHeader"><a href="/2021/12/16/CommentsTest.html">Test post for Mastodon Comments</a></h2>
      <p>I’ve been struggling with having comments on this Jekyll-based static site for a while. For a bit, I used Staticman, but that died for some reason.</p>

<p>Then, it hit me: so many sites use Facebook comments. Why can’t I use Mastodon, the FOSS alternative social media system, to do something similar?</p>

<p>Fortunately, <a href="https://blog.xmgz.eu/jekyll-mastodon-comment/">this guide</a> provided all the code I could need to do exactly that!</p>

<p>So this is a test run. Feel free to comment on it using your Mastodon account. (I think other federated accounts might work, but not sure – if so, let me know in the comments!)</p>

<p>If you don’t have a Mastodon account, don’t worry! You can <a href="https://joinmastodon.org">sign up for an instance</a> and join the federated fun.</p>

<h2 id="update-1">UPDATE #1</h2>

<p>I’ve tested it a bit and have found a few things that give me pause:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It does not respect the distinction between Unlisted and Public privacy settings. Both will show up here.</li>
  <li>It <em>does</em> respect DM – that is, DMs do not show up as comments.</li>
  <li><del>It does not respect Content Warnings.</del> This has been fixed; see Update #3.</li>
</ul>

<p>With all that in mind, I think I may keep it (pending further testing) and include a warning in the “Comments” section.</p>

<h2 id="update-2">UPDATE #2</h2>
<p>Thanks to another Mastodoner, I found that if anyone who uses Mastodon to comment on a blog post deletes said comment, then it will also no longer appear on the blog. I think that’s a cool feature, but I’m thinking that I have be <em>extremely clear</em> about what happens when people comment on my blog. It’s going to be public – very public – not just in the federation, but also on my website.</p>

<p>However, I’m not 100% certain this is wise. I’d love to get more opinions from Mastodon users. Feel free to leave them in the comments – or, to be certain that your opinion is expressed privately, DM me (@robertwgehl@scholar.social).</p>

<h2 id="update-3">UPDATE #3</h2>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://mastodon.acc.sunet.se/@ashwinvis">@ashwinvis</a>, the comments system now supports Content Warnings. @ashwinvis wrote a few lines of Javascript that did the trick, resulting in CWs appearing with a small dropdown.</p>

      <h2 class="postHeader"><a href="/2021/10/30/PraiseMastodonAgain.html">In Praise of Mastodon, Again</a></h2>
      <p>Earlier this year, in the wake of the attempted coup that happened right here, live, on TV, in these United States, I wrote <a href="https://fossacademic.tech/2021/01/08/PraiseMastodon.html">a post praising how Mastodon handled the alt-right and Donald Trump</a>. As I saw it, Mastodon’s swift action against the alt-right (specifically, their quick repudiation of Gab) was a very different approach than the corporate platform approach of Facebook and Twitter. Yes, the latter removed Trump. But they did so at a pretty convenient moment: after the election was over and the ad dollars were spent. Moreover, while banning Trump was a long-overdue move, it was clearly inadequate. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/22/jan-6-capitol-riot-facebook/">As investigative journalism is revealing</a>, Facebook in particular did little to quell the planning of the January 6 insurrection.</p>

<p>I come again to praise Mastodon. This time, for quickly addressing the problem of Trump’s new platform, Truth, which appears to be a fork (or simply CTRL+F and replace) of Mastodon’s code. That in itself is not the issue – after all, Mastodon is FOSS, and people can therefore take it and use it. The issue is that Trump is claiming to <em>own</em> the code.</p>

<p>Derp.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/10/trumps-new-social-media-platform-found-using-mastodon-code/">Mastodon’s response</a> – as well as <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2021/oct/21/trump-group-agplv3/">that of the Software Freedom Conservancy</a> – is to give Trump 30 days to quit claiming ownership of the code or be in violation of the license.</p>

<p>To my mind, this is like a powerful force hitting a very stupid object. It seems obvious that Trump will have to relinquish his claims that the code is proprietary.</p>

<p>Then again, Trump is notorious for doing things and then daring people to lawyer up, dragging his feet by using the courts. It’s clearly what he’s hoping to do with the January 6 investigation, and I wouldn’t be surprised if he does the same with Mastodon and the SFC.</p>

<p>But those are Trump’s flaws. Again, I come to praise Mastodon, once again, for showing nerve and a steel spine where corporations with a great deal more revenue, lobbying power, and users didn’t do in the first place: call Trump out on his bullshit.</p>

      <p>I used an exclamation point intentionally, because the <a href="https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/appointments">Appointments app for Nextcloud</a> is just that awesome.</p>

<p>As a professor, I keep office hours and encourage students to meet with me. And, I also need to advise graduate students at various institutions around the world. And this is not to mention meeting with other professors I’m collaborating with – again, from around the world.</p>

<p>In the past, setting up meetings went a bit like this:</p>

<p>Them: Hey, can we meet? 
Me: Sure! When do you want to meet?
Them: I’m free Mondays and Fridays. 
Me: How about noon on Monday?
Them: Actually, I have an appointment them. What day of the week works for you?
Me: Wednesdays and Fridays.
Them: Great! What about 1 on Wednesday?
Me: Sure! 
Them: What timezone are you in?
Me: Central.
Them: Oh! Then 1 pm for you is 9 pm for me.</p>

<p>Etc, etc. Each of these being an email, of course, and usually with a delay of several hours between them.</p>

<p>As they used to say in the commercials, “there’s got to be a better way!”</p>

<p>Nextcloud Appointments is that better way.</p>

<p>One thing I have done in the intervening past few weeks is publish another post to The Reboot, this time <a href="https://thereboot.com/cracking-open-the-android-ios-grip-on-smartphones-and-the-mobile-internet/">focusing on the state of FOSS phones</a>.

<p>And, I’ve been steadily working on a co-authored paper on Mastodon, the federated social networking site.</p>

<p>So, a lot going on, and a lot more to come!</p>

<p>In fact, I’m getting ever closer to revealing my Goal 2: Book Project on the blog. I want to blog out my progress openly. To do that, of course, I’ll have to clarify my project!</p>

      <h2 class="postHeader"><a href="/2021/07/03/DeGoogleSearch.html">(Almost) De-Googled Research</a></h2>
      <p>Big news on the search front! The Brave Browser is now <a href="https://search.brave.com/">offering a search engine</a>. According to <a href="https://brave.com/brave-search-beta/">their announcment</a>, Brave Search promises “independent option for search which gives them unmatched privacy” and will use an independent index, rather than rely on Google or Microsoft. I’ve already started playing with Brave Search and am curious to see how it develops.</p>

<p>However, any time someone offers a search engine and their corporate parent isn’t named Alphabet, there’s a pretty predictable reaction: “Good on them for trying, but you just can’t beat Google.”  I’ve also heard academics say the same thing: “I can’t find anything without Google.”</p>

<p>Search is, of course, a very common approach to conducting research, and it’s especially important to my work on Internet cultures. One key way to study the Internet is by searching it. And it seems as though that means all my work ought to flow through Google.</p>

<p>I hadn’t really thought much about this situation until just recently. Along with Sean Lawson, I co-authored a book, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/social-engineering"><em>Social Engineering: How Crowdmasters, Phreaks, Hackers, and Trolls Created a New Form of Manipulative Communication</em></a>. It will come out from MIT Press in a few months.</p>

<p>The book is the result of four years of research on hacker social engineering practices as well as early 20th century propaganda and public relations (a field that also referred to its activity as “social engineering”). After finishing this latest book, I realized I’m a living testament to the fact that yes, you can de-Google your search and still conduct research. Because that’s what I did.</p>

      <p>I’ve not posted for a while. And that’s ok. Why? Because we all need a break. A vacation.</p>

<p>You. You there. You should take a break.</p>

<p>I did. It’s ok. The work will be there later.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/gentooBeach.jpg" alt="A Gentoo penguin frolicking on a beach somewhere" title="A Gentoo penguin frolicking on a beach somewhere" /></p>

<p>While traveling with family and seeing my friends, I once again relied heavily on a device I begrudgingly have: a mobile phone, in this case a Google Android device. While I work really hard to avoid apps or limit their permissions, I just <em>don’t like</em> having Google anything in my pocket.</p>

<p>And while I have a <a href="https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/">PinePhone</a> Braveheart edition, it’s just not ready to be my main phone.</p>

<p>So, in the interim, I’m doing something I should have done a while ago: trying out <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/">F-Droid</a>, the FOSS collection of Android apps.</p>

<p>I was inspired in part by an interview I had with <a href="https://twitter.com/felimwhiteley">Félim Whiteley</a> of the <a href="https://latenightlinux.com/">Late Night Linux</a> podcast. Whiteley is a well-known de-Googler. The interview will be used as a part of the research for a forthcoming <a href="https://thereboot.com">Reboot</a> article I’m working on.</p>

<p>So I guess the vacation wasn’t all vacation, because I found myself mucking about with FOSS, once again. This time on my phone. But, hey, that’s the FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream for you. I can’t turn it off easily.</p>

      <p>Just a short post to note I have succumbed to the dark side.</p>

<p>This whole pandemic has increased the amount of screen time we all endure, and I’ve increasingly recognized that dark modes feel better on my eyes. I started using the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/">Dark Reader</a> extension in Firefox to invert colors, and I set Mate to a dark theme on all my devices. After a few weeks of this, I realized that I liked the look of FOSS Academic when it was rendered using Dark Reader.</p>

<p>So, using the magic of <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> – I am loving SASS! – I changed a couple variables and BOOM! We’re doing FOSS after dark like were <a href="https://latenightlinux.com/">Joe, Félim, Graham, and Will</a>.</p>

<p>If you see any issues with the styling, let me know in the comments. I still have to style the comments – I’ll get to it someday – but in the meantime, enjoy the dark.</p>

      <p><em>UPDATE in 2022</em>: I’ve added the ability to comment via Mastodon on this post (see below) since this post is one of the more popular ones on the blog.</p>

<p>Zotero recently announced two major new features: an internal PDF reader and tab-based navigation. These are scheduled to be a part of the Zotero 6 release later this year, but when I heard about them, <a href="/2021/03/19/cuttingZotero.html">I installed the Zotero 5 developer version</a> to give them a whirl.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/zotero.png" alt="Zotero's Logo" />

<p>My quick take on the new features? They are now a key part of the FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream.</p>

      <h2 class="postHeader"><a href="/2021/03/28/RMMess.html">RM Mess</a></h2>
      <p>I guess I have strange timing.</p>

<p>I just got done reading Sam Williams’s 2002 book <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/free-as-in-freedom-paperback-richard-stallman-s-crusade-for-free-software/9781449324643">Free As In Freedom: Richard Stallman’s Crusade for Free Software</a>.</em> I started reading it about March 15 or so.</p>

<p>At the time, I thought of Stallman as largely in the background of the world of FOSS, since of course he resigned from the Free Software Foundation back in 2019. I knew that he was called out for some comments about Marvin Minsky and the Jeffrey Epstein case – comments that were, at best, tone-deaf and, at worst, apologies for the sexual predation of children. I also knew of increasing numbers of women who reported Stallman’s behavior made them uncomfortable and even unsafe.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/williams.jpg" alt="The Cover of Williams's book Free as in Freedom, a biography of Richard Stallman" />
    <figcaption>The Cover of Williams's book Free as in Freedom, a biography of Richard Stallman</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But since I’m putting together Goal 2 – a book-length research project about FOSS – I figured that I need to engage with Stallman in some form, even if he was fading into the background.</p>

<p>So Williams’s book caught my eye. As I read, I came across curious moments that may have appeared differently in 2002 than they do to this reader in 2021.</p>

<p>My intention was to read the book and post a bit about it here, as I did with <a href="/2020/12/06/Dreaming-In-Code.html"><em>Dreaming In Code</em></a> as part of my larger research project into FOSS.</p>

<p>But it turns out that I also finished the book in time for RM Mess 2.0. So this is changing from a book review into a post that connect Williams’s now two-decades old biography with a current event.</p>

<p>Content warnings: this post discusses sexual assault, child exploitation, and harassment. You might want to skip it on those grounds. Moreover, if you’re tired of discussions of Stallman, you also might want to skip this post.</p>

<p>Zotero just announced a <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/pdf_reader_preview">preview of their new tab system, complete with a built-in PDF reader</a>.</p>

<p>They plan on releasing these features to the public in Version 6, but anyone itching to try it can use the development version of Zotero. This post will discuss how to install Zotero’s beta in Ubuntu Mate 18.04, though the approach should be similar for other Linux distros.</p>

      <p>A quick note to any readers in GDPR regulated areas: I’m in the USA, and I don’t really do business in Europe. I don’t really do business anywhere, to be honest. Anyway, I also really respect privacy concerns. So, in the interest of transparency, I want to note that I use a <a href="https://www.statcounter.com">Statcounter</a> script to help track traffic to this blog.</p>

<p>Edit on March 20: Oops! I forgot about Javascript from Heroku, enabling <a href="https://staticman.net/">Staticman comments</a>. I was reminded of this when I got a comment from a reader.

<p>I popped over to <a href="https://itsfoss.com/pdf-editors-linux/">It’s FOSS</a> to see their list of top applications. When your list starts with LibreOffice Draw… I don’t know what to say. It gets worse from there, going to a bunch of commercial, proprietary solutions.</p>

<p>I now work for an organization that makes heavy use of PDF forms. I lament the lost hours.</p>

      <p>Sometimes, the FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream can hurt you.</p>

<p>I spent the weekend installing <a href="https://manjaro.org/">Manjaro</a> on a laptop. I’m starting to really like Manjaro after years of using Debian-based things like Ubuntu and Mint. I know using Manjaro doesn’t really allow me to say “<a href="https://us-browse.startpage.com/av/anon-image?piurl=https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FDplToN8UwAAVKrG.jpg&amp;sp=1614633024Td5a5c55f91dbaa7f113abecead862dd2c93f7b804f24473957dcb450b1f72a9e">I use Arch btw</a>” but it’s really fun, nonetheless.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/manjaro.png" alt="Manjaro Linux Logo" /></p>

<p>I used my Manjaro box to write up a post for the blog, but then I had the bright idea of trying to install a second OS on it, I borked it, and then re-installed… losing the post I wrote. Ah, well. Such is FALD life.</p>

<p>I have Manjaro up and running (with MATE, of course), though – I’m starting to think it could be my next working distro.</p>

<p>[That said, I’m writing this on an Ubuntu box.]</p>

      <h2 class="postHeader"><a href="/2021/02/09/MastodonSurvey.html">A Survey for Mastodon Developers, Admins, and Users</a></h2>
      <p>A quick note: I’m conducting a survey with a colleague of mine, <a href="https://cla.purdue.edu/facultyStaff/profiles/new/newfaculty-18/Zulli_Diana.html">Dr. Diana Zulli</a>. We’re interested in learning from Mastodon developers, admins, and users about “freedom of expression.”</p>

<p>I will post the link to the survey in Mastodon, rather than here. If you use Mastodon, I hope you see it there.</p>

<p>I wanted to note one thing about the survey: we’re offering a small bit of compensation for people’s time (at least, the first 75 or so people – after that, the funding runs out.) Because of where we work, we are using Qualtrics for the survey, and the only real way to compensate people and protect people’s private information is by using Amazon gift cards. We realize you may not share the same values as Amazon. We talked about this problem at length and decided to go ahead with the incentives. If you have interest in doing the survey but no interes in Amazon, you can skip the final questions of the survey.</p>

<p>If you have questions about this survey, hit me up on Mastodon (@robertwgehl@scholar.social) or via the email address listed here.</p>

      <p>I <a href="https://scholar.social/@robertwgehl/105675026053096230">posted a question to Mastodon</a> (specifically, scholar.social):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ok! If you had a good budget to build a cloud infrastructure to support small teams (2-5 people) collaborating on projects, with a special focus on academic writing projects, what would you recommend?</p>

  <p>I’m thinking Linux-based cloud stuff, so I have in mind:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Nextcloud</li>
    <li>Jitsi</li>
    <li>Matrix</li>
  </ul>

  <p>and…? Any recommendations?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I asked this question in all seriousness. I am lucky enough to have a small amount of research funding, I want to promote the world of software beyond Google and Microsoft, and so I’m really keen on building a FOSS Academic Laboratory in the cloud and using to for any collaborative projects I’m a part of. After all, it’s my <a href="/about.html">Goal #1</a>: to use FOSS for as much of my academic work as is possible.</p>

    <figcaption>This penguin's got questions.</figcaption>

<p>The response I got to the questions was <em>freakin’ awesome!</em></p>

<p>I thought it would be a good idea to catalog it here. I’ll start with the least-recommended things and work my way up to the most-recommended. That’s not to say this is a ranking – things mentioned only once might be really valuable. I’m really just noting what was mentioned most.</p>

<p>I’ll also note which ones I am considering deploying – again, this is not a commentary on the quality of any of these systems. It’s more related to my own specific use cases forged in the past decade of academic collaborations.</p>

      <p>In a previous post, I disparaged 2020. But hey, just wait: 2021 has already become pretty bad. As you probably have seen, pro-Trump supporters decided to invade the U.S. Capitol on January 6.</p>

<p>I am not a tech determinist, which means that I do not seek to explain complexity by only considering changes in technology. So I am not going to say that corporate social media – including Facebook and Twitter – caused what happened yesterday. In other words, I am not going to say that the spread of misinformation was the reason for people to blithely walk past the cops and into the Rotunda. To do so would ignore a host of other factors, such as the history of racism in the United States and the desire for politicians to aggrandize themselves.</p>

<p>So I’m not saying Facebook and Twitter are to blame. What I will say, however, is that one contributing factor to the events of January 6, 2021 – not the sole determining factor – is corporate social media.</p>

<p><a href="https://thereboot.com/"><em>The Reboot</em></a> looks really promising – it’s a magazine dedicated to Internet criticism. I’ve been known to do a bit of that.</p>

<p>Another little update: I installed the Hyvor comment system but then removed it. It worked, which is great, but I missed <a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/removing-free-plan/">the free window</a> and I don’t know if I have the traffic to justify using a paid plan. I may go back to it, but I want to explore other options first. Next up: <a href="https://staticman.net/docs/">StaticMan</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, I am teaching my child how to use Linux and want to make a recommendation: <a href="https://gitlab.com/slackermedia/bashcrawl">BashCrawl</a>! It’s a text-based game for the Bash terminal that teaches how to use bash commands. Within half an hour, my kid was showing me some cool bash techniques. Just download an archive, unzip it, and dive in.</p>

<p>Put it in the dumpster, man.</p>

<p>But the end of the worst year ever is also the end of the 2010s, so maybe now’s a good time to reflect on my past decade as a FOSS Academic. As I mentioned in the <a href="/2020/11/27/introduction.html">Introduction</a>, I’ve been using FOSS tools to do my job as a university professor for over a decade. Now, I’m looking ahead to the next decade.</p>

<p>Here, I want to document my workflow. It’s a combination of desktop environments, workspace management, weekly planning and long-term goals. I’ve been developing it over the past decade, and I think it’s time I formally document just how I do what I do.</p>

      <p>A minor update: I’m still learning how to use <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and one goal I had was a usable tagging system. I think I’ve achieved it! I want to study the problem more and see if I can’t automate more parts of it, but so far, so good. If you have feedback, leave it in the comments!</p>

      <p>A <a href="https://destinationlinux.org/episode-198/">recent <em>Destination Linux</em> podcast</a> interviewed Neal Gompa, a Fedora contributor, and their first question was: how did you start using Linux? I won’t recap Gompa’s story – I’d recommend listening to the show – but suffice it to say it involves an old copy of Red Hat he randomly found.</p>

<p>I thought about Gompa’s story and the question of getting started with FOSS and started reflecting on my own FOSS journey. As an academic – and a non-computer science academic, at that – I think my story is pretty unique.</p>

<p>It all started with Windows Vista.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://linuxunplugged.com/">Linux Unplugged podcast</a> is hosting their first-ever Tuxies award. They’re <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJImbr7PdPA5oHwv4HUtVA6nspYYqYnG5W0hqrjaSI1AZebw/viewform?usp=send_form">soliciting votes</a> for a range of categories of FOSS projects.</p>

<p>I thought it might be good to nominate things from the FOSS Academic point of view, celebrating projects that help me do my academic work. So, here are the votes I cast.</p>

      <h2 class="postHeader"><a href="/2020/12/06/Dreaming-In-Code.html">Dreaming in code</a></h2>
      <p>There have been a lot of books that have influenced my career: Fred Turner’s <em>From Counterculture to Cyberculture,</em> Gabriella Coleman’s <em>Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy,</em> Karl Marx’s <em>Grundrisse,</em> John Law’s <em>Aircraft Stories,</em> and Patricia Hill Collin’s <em>Black Feminist Thought.</em> These works are a kind of well to return to, again and again, to quench intellectual thirsts: thinking historically about communication technologies, and thinking about heterogeneity in the cultures of communication technologies.</p>

<p>But perhaps the closest to my heart, one of the books that came along at just the right moment in my career – a bubbling spring of the well – is Scott Rosenberg’s <a href="http://www.dreamingincode.com/"><em>Dreaming In Code</em></a>.</p>

<p>As a university professor, I do a lot of different things, many of them having to do with technologies. I engage in research, write articles and books, put together syllabi, work with students, and collaborate with colleagues. All of these require the use of networked computers. But I don’t use Windows and I don’t use Apple.</p>
