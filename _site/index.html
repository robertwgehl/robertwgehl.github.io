      <p>It’s been a while since I blogged about how I do all my academic work using free and open source software – otherwise known as the “FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream.” In fact, the last time I wrote about this was <a href="/2020/12/27/Workflow.html">2020</a>!</p>

      <p>This weekly <a href="/tags/asm update.html">Alternative Social Media update</a> – the first of 2025! – is about getting caught back up with some things that have happened in the past month. First up, I’ll relate the latest changes at Meta to a specific interest of mine, Threads’s fediverse blocklist. Then, I’ll point you to a very fascinating back-and-forth discussion about Bluesky’s ATProto and ActivityPub (as well as OCapN). Finally, I’ll let you know the latest in ActivityPub Trust and Safety.</p>

      <p>It’s a simple, yet deep ASM update for this week. Last week, I posted about some <a href="/2024/11/22/ASMupdateResearch.html">recent research</a> in the realm of alternative social media. I also drew attention to the bibliography I maintain <a href="/bib.html">here on this blog</a>. In response to that post, folks on the fediverse alerted me to other bibliographic projects collecting research in related ideas. Here I want to highlight two of them.</p>

      <p>Nothing major this month, but I do want to note two things. First, I wrote a post on the fediverse that must have hit a nerve. It’s about corporations selling off academic work to AI companies. Second, I presented research to a panel at the IETF, talking about the development of ActivityPub by the W3C’s Social Web Working Group. The presentation is based on my <a href="/2024/02/11/Move-Slowy-Preview.html">forthcoming book</a>.</p>

The list (as of this writng) has over 660 entries. Since I am finalizing a chapter on Threads for my <a href="/2024/02/11/Move-Slowy-Preview.html">forthcoming book</a>, I will definitely have to consider this list in detail.

  <p>The internet is an exceptional tool for people of all ages to learn, play and connect with family, friends and those with similar interests. However, just like the outside world, the digital world can pose significant dangers. Social media can be used to sexually exploit children, promote self-harm to children, incite violence, put people’s safety at risk and foment hate. Online harms have real-world impacts with tragic, even fatal, consequences.</p>

      <p>In a couple days, I head to Philadelphia for the 2023 version of the Association of Internet Researchers conference. It’s my favorite conference. And to give AOIR even more credit, they were one of the first professional academic organizations to set up <a href="https://aoir.social">their own Mastodon instance</a> (I participate in that project by helping run the instance).</p>

      <p>So I tried to take part in Fediforum today, but I wasn’t really able to participate. My initial idea was to get into a debate with my friend <a href="https://test.roelof.info/">Roel Roscam Abbing</a>, who is an incredibly deep thinker and is writing what will no doubt be a foundational dissertation about the fediverse. We were hoping to prompt a discussion about importable, instance blocklists on the fediverse.</p>

      <p>As I’ve written before, I’m working on a book about the fediverse. To do that properly, I need to have a good understanding of ActivityPub, a key underlying protocol that enables servers to talk to one another. A member of one ActivityPub-enabled server, such as Mastodon, can connect with another on a different server – even if it runs different software, such as Pixelfed. It’s quite a technical achievement and – I believe – it really needs to be part of the conversation when we discuss things like moderation, platform governance, and the political economy of the internet.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, in the wake of the attempted coup that happened right here, live, on TV, in these United States, I wrote <a href="https://fossacademic.tech/2021/01/08/PraiseMastodon.html">a post praising how Mastodon handled the alt-right and Donald Trump</a>. As I saw it, Mastodon’s swift action against the alt-right (specifically, their quick repudiation of Gab) was a very different approach than the corporate platform approach of Facebook and Twitter. Yes, the latter removed Trump. But they did so at a pretty convenient moment: after the election was over and the ad dollars were spent. Moreover, while banning Trump was a long-overdue move, it was clearly inadequate. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/22/jan-6-capitol-riot-facebook/">As investigative journalism is revealing</a>, Facebook in particular did little to quell the planning of the January 6 insurrection.</p>

On the other hand, these are for-profit corporations which are largely built to drive our attention towards brand and marketing messages.</p>
