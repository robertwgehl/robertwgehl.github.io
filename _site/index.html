      <h2 class="postHeader"><a href="/2021/01/24/Staticman.html">Staticman Comments Test Post</a></h2>
      <p>This post is to test Staticman comments. I’ll edit this post later to update my progress. For now, if anyone stumbles across this and wants to add a “test” comment or something helpful, feel free!</p>

<p>I’m basing this process of this <a href="https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2020/02/05/now-with-comments.html">helpful blog post</a> from Travis Downs of Performance Matters. Thank you!</p>

<p>Update 1: There are clearly problems in my configuration, and so I must keep debugging. But it’s time for a walk.</p>

<p>Update 2: Success in posting a comment after turning ReCaptcha off. However, not sure if I set things up to <em>display</em> the comment…</p>

<p>Update 3: Success in getting a comment posted! But the workflow is very convoluted. I know Staticman uses Github pull requests to work, so I have to merge each comment. That’s fine. However, after I do so, I will have to move the data from my local version of my static site and then rebuild it via Jekyll. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INX-KrjaNOo">There has to be a better way</a>! And I will figure it out.</p>

<p>And, I do know I will have to style the comments, as well. One thing at a time.</p>

<p>Update 4: I think it’s done! Comment forms are styled for desktop and mobile, and the workflow is now improved. I initially set up my Github repository to be only the contents of the _site folder, but now the whole thing (warts and all) is in Github, which makes moderating comments much easier.</p>

<p>Once again, thanks go to Travis Downs for his exhaustive post on how to get Staticman going, as well as some of his code.</p>

<p>I do have a few more tweaks, but the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwZwkk7q25I">system is not down</a>.</p>

      <p>Wikipedia is 20 years old this year. Congratulations! Celebrations abound across the Internet.</p>

<p>As a scholar of Wikipedia and a FOSS Academic, I wanted to weigh in on the birthday and provide a short history lesson. (This is, therefore, a <a href="/tags/goal 2.html">Goal 2 post</a>).</p>

      <p>In a previous post, I disparaged 2020. But hey, just wait: 2021 has already become pretty bad. As you probably have seen, pro-Trump supporters decided to invade the U.S. Capitol on January 6.</p>

<p>I am not a tech determinist, which means that I do not seek to explain complexity by only considering changes in technology. So I am not going to say that corporate social media – including Facebook and Twitter – caused what happened yesterday. In other words, I am not going to say that the spread of misinformation was the reason for people to blithely walk past the cops and into the Rotunda. To do so would ignore a host of other factors, such as the history of racism in the United States and the desire for politicians to aggrandize themselves.</p>

<p>So I’m not saying Facebook and Twitter are to blame. What I will say, however, is that one contributing factor to the events of January 6, 2021 – not the sole determining factor – is corporate social media.</p>

<p>And thus I come in praise of Mastodon.</p>

      <h2 class="postHeader"><a href="/2020/12/29/Minor-Update.html">Minor Update -- New Publication, No More Hyvor</a></h2>
      <p>A minor update: I have a new publication about <a href="https://thereboot.com/creating-decentralized-social-media-alternatives-to-facebook-and-twitter/">alternative social media</a> in <em>The Reboot.</em> The piece discusses two FOSS alternatives to Twitter: the amazing, and yet likely <a href="http://twister.net.co/news/">soon-to-be-defunct</a> Twister, which is a P2P, distributed microblog. I also discuss my favorite project, Mastodon.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/reboot.png" alt="The Reboot logo" title="The Reboot logo" />
    <figcaption>The Reboot logo</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><a href="https://thereboot.com/"><em>The Reboot</em></a> looks really promising – it’s a magazine dedicated to Internet criticism. I’ve been known to do a bit of that.</p>

<p>Another little update: I installed the Hyvor comment system but then removed it. It worked, which is great, but I missed <a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/removing-free-plan/">the free window</a> and I don’t know if I have the traffic to justify using a paid plan. I may go back to it, but I want to explore other options first. Next up: <a href="https://staticman.net/docs/">StaticMan</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, I am teaching my child how to use Linux and want to make a recommendation: <a href="https://gitlab.com/slackermedia/bashcrawl">BashCrawl</a>! It’s a text-based game for the Bash terminal that teaches how to use bash commands. Within half an hour, my kid was showing me some cool bash techniques. Just download an archive, unzip it, and dive in.</p>

      <p>The year 2020. Damn. Damn, damn, damn, damn.</p>

<p>Put it in the dumpster, man.</p>

<p>But the end of the worst year ever is also the end of the 2010s, so maybe now’s a good time to reflect on my past decade as a FOSS Academic. As I mentioned in the <a href="/2020/11/27/introduction.html">Introduction</a>, I’ve been using FOSS tools to do my job as a university professor for over a decade. Now, I’m looking ahead to the next decade.</p>

<p>Here, I want to document my workflow. It’s a combination of desktop environments, workspace management, weekly planning and long-term goals. I’ve been developing it over the past decade, and I think it’s time I formally document just how I do what I do.</p>

<p>It’s a longish post, but then again, <a href="https://youtu.be/K9ZQhyOZCNE?t=486">we’re talking about practice</a>. That gets complex!</p>

      <p>A minor update: I’m still learning how to use <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and one goal I had was a usable tagging system. I think I’ve achieved it! I want to study the problem more and see if I can’t automate more parts of it, but so far, so good. If you have feedback, leave it in the comments!</p>

      <p>A <a href="https://destinationlinux.org/episode-198/">recent <em>Destination Linux</em> podcast</a> interviewed Neal Gompa, a Fedora contributor, and their first question was: how did you start using Linux? I won’t recap Gompa’s story – I’d recommend listening to the show – but suffice it to say it involves an old copy of Red Hat he randomly found.</p>

<p>I thought about Gompa’s story and the question of getting started with FOSS and started reflecting on my own FOSS journey. As an academic – and a non-computer science academic, at that – I think my story is pretty unique.</p>

      <h2 class="postHeader"><a href="/2020/12/06/Dreaming-In-Code.html">Dreaming in code</a></h2>
      <p>There have been a lot of books that have influenced my career: Fred Turner’s <em>From Counterculture to Cyberculture,</em> Gabriella Coleman’s <em>Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy,</em> Karl Marx’s <em>Grundrisse,</em> John Law’s <em>Aircraft Stories,</em> and Patricia Hill Collin’s <em>Black Feminist Thought.</em> These works are a kind of well to return to, again and again, to quench intellectual thirsts: thinking historically about communication technologies, and thinking about heterogeneity in the cultures of communication technologies.</p>

<p>But perhaps the closest to my heart, one of the books that came along at just the right moment in my career – a bubbling spring of the well – is Scott Rosenberg’s <a href="http://www.dreamingincode.com/"><em>Dreaming In Code</em></a>.</p>

<p>As a university professor, I do a lot of different things, many of them having to do with technologies. I engage in research, write articles and books, put together syllabi, work with students, and collaborate with colleagues. All of these require the use of networked computers. But I don’t use Windows and I don’t use Apple.</p>
