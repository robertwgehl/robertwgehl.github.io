      <p>There’s exciting news on the Zotero front!</p>

<p>Zotero just announced a <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/pdf_reader_preview">preview of their new tab system, complete with a built-in PDF reader</a>.</p>

<p>For anyone living the FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream, this is huge news.</p>

    <figcaption>The Zotero logo is in the public domain.</figcaption>

<p>They plan on releasing these features to the public in Version 6, but anyone itching to try it can use the development version of Zotero. This post will discuss how to install Zotero’s beta in Ubuntu Mate 18.04, though the approach should be similar for other Linux distros.</p>

      <p>A quick note to any readers in GDPR regulated areas: I’m in the USA, and I don’t really do business in Europe. I don’t really do business anywhere, to be honest. Anyway, I also really respect privacy concerns. So, in the interest of transparency, I want to note that I use a <a href="https://www.statcounter.com">Statcounter</a> script to help track traffic to this blog.</p>

<p>You can see the Javascript in the page source for the blog, and I’ve also <a href="https://statcounter.com/p5832197/summary/?account_id=1462290&amp;login_id=3&amp;code=6a0a1540cdf3119c0be6e16464d0d1fe&amp;guest_login=1">made the stats public</a> (marvel at my traffic!).</p>

<p>If you block Javascript, I not only don’t mind, nothing should change for you. The site will function just fine with Javascript blocked.</p>

<p>Moreover, if you have a better way to get basic traffic data for a Github.io-hosted static Jekyll blog, let me know in the comments or via Mastodon (@robertwgehl@scholar.social).</p>

<p>Please don’t tell me to use LaTex.</p>

<p>I’m barely keeping things together using Atril and pdfunite in the command line.</p>

<p>I popped over to <a href="https://itsfoss.com/pdf-editors-linux/">It’s FOSS</a> to see their list of top applications. When your list starts with LibreOffice Draw… I don’t know what to say. It gets worse from there, going to a bunch of commercial, proprietary solutions.</p>

<p>I now work for an organization that makes heavy use of PDF forms. I lament the lost hours.</p>

<p>Printing and scanning seems like the most efficient thing to do.</p>

<p>At this point, feel free to tell me to switch to Windows.</p>

      <p>Sometimes, the FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream can hurt you.</p>

<p>I spent the weekend installing <a href="https://manjaro.org/">Manjaro</a> on a laptop. I’m starting to really like Manjaro after years of using Debian-based things like Ubuntu and Mint. I know using Manjaro doesn’t really allow me to say “<a href="https://us-browse.startpage.com/av/anon-image?piurl=https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FDplToN8UwAAVKrG.jpg&amp;sp=1614633024Td5a5c55f91dbaa7f113abecead862dd2c93f7b804f24473957dcb450b1f72a9e">I use Arch btw</a>” but it’s really fun, nonetheless.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/manjaro.png" alt="Manjaro Linux Logo" /></p>

<p>I used my Manjaro box to write up a post for the blog, but then I had the bright idea of trying to install a second OS on it, I borked it, and then re-installed… losing the post I wrote. Ah, well. Such is FALD life.</p>

<p>I have Manjaro up and running (with MATE, of course), though – I’m starting to think it could be my next working distro.</p>

<p>[That said, I’m writing this on an Ubuntu box.]</p>

Perhaps this marks the beginning of the end of proprietary operating systems on the Red Planet?</p>

<p>Good to see the people of NASA are living the FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream.</p>

      <h2 class="postHeader"><a href="/2021/02/09/MastodonSurvey.html">A Survey for Mastodon Developers, Admins, and Users</a></h2>
      <p>A quick note: I’m conducting a survey with a colleague of mine, <a href="https://cla.purdue.edu/facultyStaff/profiles/new/newfaculty-18/Zulli_Diana.html">Dr. Diana Zulli</a>. We’re interested in learning from Mastodon developers, admins, and users about “freedom of expression.”</p>

<p>I will post the link to the survey in Mastodon, rather than here. If you use Mastodon, I hope you see it there.</p>

<p>I wanted to note one thing about the survey: we’re offering a small bit of compensation for people’s time (at least, the first 75 or so people – after that, the funding runs out.) Because of where we work, we are using Qualtrics for the survey, and the only real way to compensate people and protect people’s private information is by using Amazon gift cards. We realize you may not share the same values as Amazon. We talked about this problem at length and decided to go ahead with the incentives. If you have interest in doing the survey but no interes in Amazon, you can skip the final questions of the survey.</p>

<p>If you have questions about this survey, hit me up on Mastodon (@robertwgehl@scholar.social) or via the email address listed here.</p>

      <h2 class="postHeader"><a href="/2021/02/07/CloudAcademic.html">I Asked Mastodon About FOSS for Academics. Here's What They Said</a></h2>
      <p>I <a href="https://scholar.social/@robertwgehl/105675026053096230">posted a question to Mastodon</a> (specifically, scholar.social):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ok! If you had a good budget to build a cloud infrastructure to support small teams (2-5 people) collaborating on projects, with a special focus on academic writing projects, what would you recommend?</p>

  <p>I’m thinking Linux-based cloud stuff, so I have in mind:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Nextcloud</li>
    <li>Jitsi</li>
    <li>Matrix</li>
  </ul>

  <p>and…? Any recommendations?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I asked this question in all seriousness. I am lucky enough to have a small amount of research funding, I want to promote the world of software beyond Google and Microsoft, and so I’m really keen on building a FOSS Academic Laboratory in the cloud and using to for any collaborative projects I’m a part of. After all, it’s my <a href="/about.html">Goal #1</a>: to use FOSS for as much of my academic work as is possible.</p>

    <figcaption>This penguin's got questions.</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>The response I got to the questions was <em>freakin’ awesome!</em></p>

<p>I thought it would be a good idea to catalog it here. I’ll start with the least-recommended things and work my way up to the most-recommended. That’s not to say this is a ranking – things mentioned only once might be really valuable. I’m really just noting what was mentioned most.</p>

<p>I’ll also note which ones I am considering deploying – again, this is not a commentary on the quality of any of these systems. It’s more related to my own specific use cases forged in the past decade of academic collaborations.</p>

      <p>In a previous post, I disparaged 2020. But hey, just wait: 2021 has already become pretty bad. As you probably have seen, pro-Trump supporters decided to invade the U.S. Capitol on January 6.</p>

<p>I am not a tech determinist, which means that I do not seek to explain complexity by only considering changes in technology. So I am not going to say that corporate social media – including Facebook and Twitter – caused what happened yesterday. In other words, I am not going to say that the spread of misinformation was the reason for people to blithely walk past the cops and into the Rotunda. To do so would ignore a host of other factors, such as the history of racism in the United States and the desire for politicians to aggrandize themselves.</p>

<p>So I’m not saying Facebook and Twitter are to blame. What I will say, however, is that one contributing factor to the events of January 6, 2021 – not the sole determining factor – is corporate social media.</p>

      <p>A minor update: I have a new publication about <a href="https://thereboot.com/creating-decentralized-social-media-alternatives-to-facebook-and-twitter/">alternative social media</a> in <em>The Reboot.</em> The piece discusses two FOSS alternatives to Twitter: the amazing, and yet likely <a href="http://twister.net.co/news/">soon-to-be-defunct</a> Twister, which is a P2P, distributed microblog. I also discuss my favorite project, Mastodon.</p>

</figure>

<p><a href="https://thereboot.com/"><em>The Reboot</em></a> looks really promising – it’s a magazine dedicated to Internet criticism. I’ve been known to do a bit of that.</p>

<p>Another little update: I installed the Hyvor comment system but then removed it. It worked, which is great, but I missed <a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/removing-free-plan/">the free window</a> and I don’t know if I have the traffic to justify using a paid plan. I may go back to it, but I want to explore other options first. Next up: <a href="https://staticman.net/docs/">StaticMan</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, I am teaching my child how to use Linux and want to make a recommendation: <a href="https://gitlab.com/slackermedia/bashcrawl">BashCrawl</a>! It’s a text-based game for the Bash terminal that teaches how to use bash commands. Within half an hour, my kid was showing me some cool bash techniques. Just download an archive, unzip it, and dive in.</p>

<p>The year 2020. Damn. Damn, damn, damn, damn.</p>

<p>Put it in the dumpster, man.</p>

<p>But the end of the worst year ever is also the end of the 2010s, so maybe now’s a good time to reflect on my past decade as a FOSS Academic. As I mentioned in the <a href="/2020/11/27/introduction.html">Introduction</a>, I’ve been using FOSS tools to do my job as a university professor for over a decade. Now, I’m looking ahead to the next decade.</p>

<p>Here, I want to document my workflow. It’s a combination of desktop environments, workspace management, weekly planning and long-term goals. I’ve been developing it over the past decade, and I think it’s time I formally document just how I do what I do.</p>

      <p>A <a href="https://destinationlinux.org/episode-198/">recent <em>Destination Linux</em> podcast</a> interviewed Neal Gompa, a Fedora contributor, and their first question was: how did you start using Linux? I won’t recap Gompa’s story – I’d recommend listening to the show – but suffice it to say it involves an old copy of Red Hat he randomly found.</p>

<p>I thought about Gompa’s story and the question of getting started with FOSS and started reflecting on my own FOSS journey. As an academic – and a non-computer science academic, at that – I think my story is pretty unique.</p>

      <p>There have been a lot of books that have influenced my career: Fred Turner’s <em>From Counterculture to Cyberculture,</em> Gabriella Coleman’s <em>Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy,</em> Karl Marx’s <em>Grundrisse,</em> John Law’s <em>Aircraft Stories,</em> and Patricia Hill Collin’s <em>Black Feminist Thought.</em> These works are a kind of well to return to, again and again, to quench intellectual thirsts: thinking historically about communication technologies, and thinking about heterogeneity in the cultures of communication technologies.</p>

<p>But perhaps the closest to my heart, one of the books that came along at just the right moment in my career – a bubbling spring of the well – is Scott Rosenberg’s <a href="http://www.dreamingincode.com/"><em>Dreaming In Code</em></a>.</p>

<p>As a university professor, I do a lot of different things, many of them having to do with technologies. I engage in research, write articles and books, put together syllabi, work with students, and collaborate with colleagues. All of these require the use of networked computers. But I don’t use Windows and I don’t use Apple.</p>
