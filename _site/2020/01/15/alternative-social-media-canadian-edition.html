<p>Just a quick update: I am now set up in my office at the University of Calgary in Alberta. I’ve come here on a Fulbright Canada Fellowship, and one of my goals is to study Canadian alternative social media. On this first full day of basic research, I’m already seeing a great deal of activity, particularly in terms of Indigenous social networking.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks, I intend to add more examples to the <a href="https://socialmediaalternatives.org/archive/">SMAP archive</a>, as well as look for opportunities to learn from the activists and coders who are developing ASM in Canada.</p>
