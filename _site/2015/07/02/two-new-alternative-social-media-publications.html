<p>I have two new alternative social media-related publications.</p>

<p>First, in <em>The New Inquiry</em>, <a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/socializing-the-dark-web/">I have an interview with Lameth</a>, the creator and admin of the Tor-based social network Galaxy2. I’m really grateful to Lameth for all his insights into social media and the dark web. Galaxy2 is <a href="http://www.socialmediaalternatives.org/archive/collections/show/10">featured in the S-MAP</a>. Even better, <a href="http://w363zoq3ylux5rf5.onion/">you ought to go to it</a> (<a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en">Tor Browser Bundle</a> required).</p>

<p>Second, I have posted a <a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=2625658">forthcoming version</a> of “The Case for Alternative Social Media,” a paper that will appear in a special issue of <em>Social Media + Society</em>. It draws on interviews with a variety of alternative social media makers and users. I’m trying to define alternative social media. I focus on their anti-advertising stances, their pedagogical features, and their experimentation with surveillance and democracy.</p>

<p>As always, feedback is welcome!</p>
