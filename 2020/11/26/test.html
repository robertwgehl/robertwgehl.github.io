<p>This is a test post. This is my first Jekyll-powered post! Jekyll strikes me as a far more polished solution to my half-baked PHP solution I used on my own home page.</p>

<p>On my homepage, I use PHP variables to create a blog and handle things like styling. The fun part is that my page can have many CSS styles, so I play around with that quite a bit.</p>

<p>The downside is that it could have benefited from more structure.</p>

<p>Jekyll can provide that structure. Moreover, I think learning Jekyll – which relies on markdown and Ruby – will be a useful skill.</p>
