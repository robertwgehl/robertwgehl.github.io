# ASM Bibliography

This is an alternative social media (ASM) bibliography, a collection of scholarly articles exploring the world of social media beyond corporate sites (such as Facebook and Twitter).

This page will be updated monthly. For more up-to-date access to the bibliography, request to join the [Social Media Alternatives Project Zotero group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/542752/social_media_alternatives_project_bibliography).

Note that inclusion in this bibliography does not mean I endorse the study. Watch the blog for critiques of some of these studies.

Also: is something missing? Let me know!
