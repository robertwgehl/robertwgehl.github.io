As you may or may not know, I wrote a book back in '14 called [*Reverse Engineering Social Media*](https://bookshop.org/books/reverse-engineering-social-media-software-culture-and-political-economy-in-new-media-capitalism/9781439910344). In it, I critiqued Facebook before it was cool to do so. I concluded the book with a call for "socialized media," social media that avoids the problems of corporate social media (e.g., mass surveillance, algorithmic manipulation of our sociality, environmental destruction). 

A key element of a more ethical social media landscape is FOSS social media, and I think we can find an example of this in Mastodon.

However, something has always felt missing in the FOSS world, and I never could put my finger on it. I'm all for freedom to use technology, but as someone trained in Science and Technolgy Studies, I get nervous when I hear things like "software is neutral" and that software development is a meritocracy. 

Through my time on Mastodon, I kept hearing about Ethical Source. Now I'm intrigued.

What is Ethical Source?
-----------------------

According to the Organization for Ethical Source, Ethical Source software adheres to seven principles:
* "Our work benefits the commons."
* "Our work is done in the open."
* "Our community strives to be welcoming and just." 
* "Our work respects accessibility as a human right."
* "Our work prioritizes the safety of people."
* "Our work protects privacy."
* "Our work deserves support."

(Visit the OES website for full description of each). Essentially, Ethical Source, like FOSS in general, is dedicated to contributing code to a common pool, but with the restriction that anyone who uses the code must respect human rights. It uses software licensing to achieve that goal.

The most notable example is the [Hippocratic License](https://firstdonoharm.dev/), a license that allows for the free use, modification, and distribution of code so long as the licensee pledges to comply with "Human Rights Principles and Human Rights Laws," especially the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

A leader in the Ethical Source movement is Coraline Emkhe, who is tirelessly demanding that software developers recognize their ethical obligations. Her talks cite human rights abuses (notably, IBM's involvement in the Nazi holocaust and contemporary software companies' contracting with US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement [ICE]). And she reminds her audiences that calls for ethics in software are nothing new, citing ACM co-founder Edmund Berkeley's campaigns for ethics in computind during the 1950s-1970s. 

I find ethical source to be fascinating and (importantly to me) raising key issues that standard FOSS does not. I am still learning about Ethical Source, but I see one major issue it raises: do lines of code have politics? And if so, what should we do about it? In other words, Ethical Source raises thorny questions about technological determinism versus the social construction of technology. 

Tech Determinism and Social Constructivism
------------------------------------------
Let's start with a critique of Ethical Source. The most common (borderline knee-jerk) reaction to calls for ethical source is the argument that "Free software is like a hammer. You can build a house with it or bash someone's head in with it." This is claim that technology is inherently neutral, and that it is human action that utilizes a technology for good or ill. This is a borderline radical constructivist argument, akin to the argument made by Grint and Woolgar in their essay "what's social about being shot?". This position holds that it is entirely up to us humans to interpret and use technologies and that technologies have no impact on how we relate to the world.

A rejoinder to that is the idea that (to paraphrase Langdon Winner) "artifacts have politics," that buildings, bridges, bombs, and code all are built within sociopolitical contexts, have political programs embedded in them, and affect social relations accordingly. Winner's most powerful example is the atomic bomb, which, he argues, is so destructive with such massive consequences that it requires a particular political structure (centralized, authoritarian) to wield it, full stop. There would be, in Winner's view, no democratic process capable of deciding whether or not to use the atomic bomb. This argument inches towards -- and some might say is a full-on example of -- technological determinism, the idea that technological change is the prime driver of social change.

I may have set up a false dichotomy here, but I believe the answer is more complex than either the constructivists or determinists would have us believe. If we think about affordances, for example, we see another way. A chair affords me the chance to sit down. I would most likely use the chair to sit. I could put the chair to other uses. I could pick it up and wield it as a weapon. But what if the chair is bolted down? Or very heavy? The physical structure of the chair makes particular uses more easy than others, but it does not preclude interpretation and alternate uses. 

Things become more complex when we think about networks of technologies, people, and practices. The chair might allow me to sit in judgment of others, or it may be my place to sit while I am being interrogated. Or it might allow me to sit with friends. Or it might allow me to sit alone. Much depends on the context in addition to the physical capacities of the chair in addition my ability to interpret its uses (an ability, we should not forget, that is not mine alone but is due to my socialization into a particular culture). 

And this complexity ramps up really quickly with code, since universal machines afford many, many uses -- while still being embedded in sociotechnical systems.

What Ethical Source proposes, then, is to allow technology developers the chance to afford particular uses while curtailing others. The Ethical Source movement sees technologies as being built within particular sociopolitical contexts. It recognizes that code has politics. But they also see the potentials of code. They seek openness or flexibility while also seeking limits to the ability of end users to use their tools to abuse other people. It recognizes that software functions in social settings, not just on an end user's computer. 

For me, the idea that code is political is not strange -- it's a fact, as far as I'm concerned -- and explicit recognition of this fact, along with mechanisms to address abuses through technology, are very welcome. But I also welcome the fact that Ethical Source remains more or less open and flexible, capable of being modified to do many things -- so long as they are just.

But... Is it Open Source?
-------------------------
Ethical Source, however, is critiqued for not being open source or free. Critics argue that it violates Freedom 0 of the Free Software definition and various principles of the Open Source Definition. The rejoinder to these critiques is that FOSS can in fact include restrictions on end uses, and that Ethical Source doesn't discriminate against end users; it discriminates against particular end *uses.*

In her talks, Emkhe often invokes Thomas Kuhn's concept of paradigms, an argument that fits well with this dilemma. I don't think these two positions (ethical source is not open/ethical source is open) will be reconciled. I see two competing programs of technical development happening, side by side, eventually drifting apart. I don't know how I feel about that, but I am very keen to follow these debates. 

Moreover, Ethical Source is evolving. I've had the privilege of joining the Ethical Source Working group, which is creating a new version of the Hippocratic License that may alleviate some concerns about openness while strengthening the emphasis on human rights.
