The Scholastic period of thinking held to a "double truth" -- the truth of reason and the truth of divine revelation.

My teacher Tim Gibson wrote about the "double helix" of post-truth.

There's a lot to meditate on here. For revelation, there is always something beyond the senses, empiricism... 

Is there a call to speak of a double truth in an informational age?

Deep. not this. but this is to say this is part of the Deep idea.
