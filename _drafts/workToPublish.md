Could be pitched to Inside Higher Ed.

I've done a lot of peer reviewing over the past decade. By my count, I've reviewed at least 85 different journal articles, ranging from paywalled publications like SAGE's *New Media & Society* to open access journals like *Lateral: The Journal of The Cultural Studies Association.* I've also published over two dozen journal articles. 

In the early years of my career, I was very active in selecting open access publications.

I still value publishing OA, but the landscape has changed somewhat. Some of my colleagues hear "open access" and they immediately think of scam journals. Others hear that term and think of having to pay a journal to publish.

the work that we do as peer reviewers is important and intense. Reviewing an article can take several hours to several days, depending on its quality, the complexity of its methods, and the specific literature its drawing on. I value the work, because I do see it as giving back, since I've published two dozen articles, which likely means more than 50 people have reviewed my own work over the past few years -- and that's not counting all the rejections I've had!

Journals, for their part, seem grateful, even offering free access to their publications for a few months.

But it would be far more valuable to me if they created some sort of credit system where I could open access one of my previously paywalled publications.
