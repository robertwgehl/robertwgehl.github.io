Zotero new workflow comments
============================

the new note system dropped highlighting. I'd like to request to have it back. Perhaps the highlighted PDF text can come over to the note with the same background?

When a quote is added to the note, it does not insert on the current paragraph, but rather creates a new paragraph. However, fixing that problem is much faster than fixing the carriage returns (and odd formatting) that comes from copying and pasting from a PDF reader. I am also really grateful that the PDF quote-grabbing no longer requires me to delete a bunch of carriage returns. That alone will save me a great deal of time.

Zotero note window is a bit laggy. It feels a bit like the early days of Zotero "Standalone," when Zotero broke out of being just a Firefox extension to being a standalone app. Over time, Zotero has gotten more snappy, so I fully expect the note and PDF reader to do so, too.

I love the fact that it includes a citation and that I can follow the note back to the page of the PDF! I did notice oddities with the page numbers in the citations -- they seemed off by 1 and I haven't figured out the pattern yet. And the cursor behavior around the citation is a bit odd -- it won't move easily with either the mouse or the keyboard. I'm guessing because this is a field, rather than editable text.

What does "note backup" do (other than the obvious)?

Tabs: so, so cool. I could pop into my library to check on another source and then immediately get back to taking notes. Or I can pop in to add tags. This is brilliant!

I don't know how I feel about the notes no longer being HTML-based, but I think it may be the right call. At least in my case, I remember using the HTML editor a lot years ago, but less over time.

not sure what the drag-n-drop line/paragraph mover is usefull for.

Whoa -- it looks like my location in a PDF was synced across devices -- on my desktop, I was dropped in exactly where I left off reading on a laptop.
