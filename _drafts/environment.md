Goal 2

We have to talk about the environmental impact of all of these computers.

On the one hand, Linux can breathe new life into old machines. This can alleviate stress on recycling and dumps, because we keep the old machines running past the lifespan that the proprietary software giants suggest the devices have.

On the other hand, I'm not sure how common it is for people to take old hardware and put Linux on it. Instead, the type of person putting Linux on all the things is also buying inexpensive hardware, like the Pi, PineBooks, Pinephones, and putting various distros on those devices. Thus we get a proliferation of cheap devices.

Fairphone is a project meant to help.
