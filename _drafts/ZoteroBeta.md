back up zotero.sqlite
back up zoteroStandalone files (I store them in .local/share). I figured this, plus the backup of zotero.sqlite, would be the easiest way to revert

download and unpack the Zotero beta. I stored them where I stored the original ZoteroStandalone -- in .local/share

Mate and the Brisk menu: right-click, choose edit menu

I put Zotero in my Office section

The command (for me) is /home/robert/.local/share/zoteroStandalone/zotero
And the icon is found in /home/robert/.local/share/zoteroStandalone/chrome/icons/default/default256.png


PART TWO: BETA OPT-IN

General and opt-in

Zotero will restart

will these tabs allow for multiple libraries? Like group and main library? That would be *awesome*.
