I guess I have ok timing.

I just got done reading Sam Williams's *Free As In Freedom: Richard Stallman's Crusade for Free Software." I started reading it about March 15 or so. At the time, I thought of Stallman as largely in the background of the world of FOSS, since of course he resigned from the Free Software Foundation back in 2019. I knew that he was called out for some comments about the Jeffrey Epstein case -- comments that were, at best, tone-deaf and, at worst, apologized for the sexual predation of children. I also knew of increasing numbers of women who reported Stallman's behavior made them uncomfortable and even unsafe.

But I figure that I need to engage with Stallman in some form, so Williams's book caught my eye. As I read, I came across curious moments that may have appeared differently in 2002 than they do to this reader in 2021.

Curious Moment #1
-----------------
Williams writes about Stallman's childhood, including his refusal to obey his mother. RMS would, for example, refuse to come to dinner and opt to read a book instead. As RMS recalls,

> "If I wanted to read, and my mother told me to go to the kitchen and eat or go to sleep, I wasn't going to listen. I saw no reason why I couldn't read. No reason why she should be able to tell me what to do, period. Essentially, what I had read about, ideas such as democracy and individual freedom, I applied to myself. I didn't see any reason to exclude children from these principles" (page 27).

Williams goes on to note RMS refused to write term papers for his English classes, because freedom.

RMS is, shall we say, notoriously consistent. His most notorious comment to date is likely the Marvin Minsky apology:

>We can imagine many scenarios, but the most plausible scenario is that she presented herself to him as entirely willing. Assuming she was being coerced by Epstein, he would have had every reason to tell her to conceal that from most of his associates.

>I’ve concluded from various examples of accusation inflation that it is absolutely wrong to use the term “sexual assault” in an accusation.

[Selam G's original Medium blog post](https://selamjie.medium.com/remove-richard-stallman-fec6ec210794) presents the full RMS email and dissects its language much better than I will here. I simply want to flag a thread of logic from RMS: freedom means, apparently, includes the freedom of children to want sex with adults. Minsky's crime, here, was not doing enough investigative work to find out if the victim was "truly" willing or serving in sexual servitude (as part of Epstein's "harem," to use RMS's term). RMS is consistent with his previous position -- children should be free to read what they wish. Children should be seen as willing sex partners. It's not assault if the child is willing!

Some of you may know I wrote a book about the Dark Web. Anyone who engages with the Dark Web has to deal with the stomach-turningly wretched specter of child expoitation. I studiously and carefully avoided child exploitation media during my research on the Dark Web, but I did engage in participant observation on Dark Web social media, and the topic often came up for debate. While there I came across many people who would condenm it, but some of whom would apologize for it. The logic the child exploitation defenders used is exactly that of RMS: children should have rights! 

I *always* took this for a shorthand: an argument for guilt-free sexual objectification and exploitation of children. Basically, the apologists for child exploitation argued that children should have the right to consent to sex with adults. That was basically the end goal of the argument for the freedom of children. RMS's trajectory here -- interview around 2000 with Williams, comments in an email thread about Epstein and Minsky -- replicate this telos.  

In RMS's case, of course his precocious childhood refusal to write term papers was one thing, but his defense of Minsky was entirely another. Perhaps RMS has made calls for the rights of children beyond being their ability to consent to sex with adults. What has been documented, however, are [similar comments invoking of "willingness" and "consent"](https://rms-open-letter.github.io/appendix) of children for sex. This echoes the logic found among the stunted political philosophies of Dark Web child exploitation advocates. Condemning RMS for these comments was absolutely correct.

Curious Moment(s) #2
--------------------
Rather than a single moment, this is more of a thread throughout Williams's book, something impossible to miss in post-2019. At one point, during lunch, Williams brings up something he's observed RMS do with women he meets: he kissed their hands.

> “Yes, I do do that,” Stallman says.  “I’ve found it’s a way of offering some affection that a lot of women will enjoy. It’s a chance to give some affection and to be appreciated for it.

Later, at another meal with RMS, RMS's girlfriend, and Williams's wife, Williams notes RMS engaging in more flirtation:

> Although more flirtatious than I remembered -- a flirtatiousness spoiled somewhat by the number of times Stallman's eyes fixated on my wife's chest -- Stallman retained the same general level of prickliness (page 198).

Notably, this comment is excised from [Version 2.0 of the book](https://sagitter.fedorapeople.org/faif-2.0.pdf) -- a version RMS himself edited. 

While the Minsky comments are presented as the proximate cause of RMS's ouster, reports of RMS's behavior towards women have contributed, as well. Selam G's original post [led to women coming forward to explain the ways in which RMS made them uncomfortable or even unsafe at MIT](https://selamjie.medium.com/remove-richard-stallman-appendix-a-a7e41e784f88). These women join the women who made similar observations -- [*back in 1983* ](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~lazowska/mit/Images/Chapter2.pdf).

I work at a Tech school. This week, I will teach a class on professional identity, and to prime the conversation, the class is reading Deneen Hatmaker's [article on the problems women face in engineering](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-0432.2012.00589.x). That article is a decade old. Its themes are the same as the MIT report from 4 decades ago. And both of those articles are echoed today -- my students *today* are saying the same thing about contemporary engineering and tech fields and the lack of acceptance of women in them. 

The call for someone like RMS to step aside is justified precisely because his presence is clearly hindering the development of so many people -- people who could be otherwise, you know, making free software. I was somewhat disappointed by the recent Linux Unplugged where Chris and Wes only focused on RMS's Minsky comments -- and not the reporting about all the harassment of women he's engaged in over the years.

Curious Moment #3
-----------------
The other curious moment isn't so curious. It's pure Stallman. Chapter 12 of Williams's book, "A Brief Journey Through Hacker Hell," documents RMS's growing rage during a drive. RMS is driving a car (with Williams along for the ride) and a friend is in a car ahead of him, leading him through a town in Hawaii to a dinner appointment. Stallman is enraged because the other driver is taking a street instead of a highway. His rage grows, and grows, until, as Williams reports, he's flailing against the steering wheel and screaming.

I don't really have to say much more than this -- the #1 cited reason why people don't like Stallman is his, as Williams puts it charitably, "prickliness." Others might characterize it as belligerence and [anger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jskq3-lpQnE). The targets of his rage include enemies of freedom, but also fellow travelers and erstwhile friends. 

RM Mess, Redux
--------------
As I said, I started reading the book around March 15, a time when RMS was not involved in the FSF. I finished it on March 21. 

I woke up on the 22nd to [the news that RMS is back](https://news.itsfoss.com/richard-stallman-is-back-at-fsf/).

I am now waking up to news that people aren't letting this slide. To date, I've seen condemnations of RMS's return to the Free Software Foundation from:

* The Electronic Frontier Foundation
* The Mozilla Foundation
* The Tor Project
* Red Hat

Inevitably, these organizations (and, I imagine, this blog post) will be condemned as the fevered reactions of froth-mouthed "cancel mobs." Indeed, Abhishek of It's FOSS is using [that language](https://news.itsfoss.com/richard-stallman-is-back-at-fsf/), as are commenters on Slashdot. 

But I wonder: how much evidence does anyone need before they are willing to accept that RMS is toxic and FOSS ought to move on? The evidence was there in Williams's book two decades ago. The evidence was in the MIT CS report four decades ago. The evidence is piling up in front of you now.
