the podcast(?) discussion with the coder who does not allow any contributions

Joins with the developer of the video game management system interviewed on Linux Unplugged. Similar conclusion: I want to make something but I'm having trouble working with others -- Github pull requests are more trouble than they're worth. 

Recommendation of Wes on LU podcast: get a community manager. 

Possible causes of the problem: proliferation of ways to implement apps. Pull requests too much to manage.
