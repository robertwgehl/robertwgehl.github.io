In a previous post, I disparaged 2020. But hey, just wait: 2021 has already become pretty bad. As you probably have seen, pro-Trump supporters decided to invade the U.S. Capitol on January 6. 

I am not a tech determinist, which means that I do not reduce complexity to changes in technology. So I am not going to say that corporate social media -- including Facebook and Twitter -- caused what happened yesterday. In other words, I am not going to say that the spread of misinformation was the reason for people to blithely walk past the cops and into the Rotunda. To do so would ignore a host of other factors, such as

* The history of racism in the United States. After all, when people say "Stop the Steal," the invariably point to "irregularities" in predominantly Black voting districts (Detroit, Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Atlanta). Moreover, as multiple people have noted, the response to the pro-Trump rioters was markedly different from the response to the Black Lives Matter protests in mid-2020.
* The desire to self-aggrandize. We all know that Trump -- a narcissist who is fully committed to positive thinking -- egged on the rioters. I would also suggest that leaders in the pro-Trump movement also seek power through status, and this ranges from Senators Cruz and Hawley through Republican representatives and down to the micro-celebrities who influence followers. People have been merrily riding the coattails of a celebrity-turned-demagogue in order to increase their prestige.
* MORE

So I'm not saying Facebook and Twitter are to blame. What I will say, however, is that one contributing factor -- not the sole determining factor -- is corporate social media. 

Why?

These platforms have for years been developed to monetize the content that spreads the farthest keeps people's attention -- no matter what that content is. We all may have thought it was cute cat videos, but it's turned out that the stuff that spreads and keeps eyeballs are beguiling conspiracy theories. 

But this isn't the only monetization happening. Corporate social media also privileges paid content -- that is, advertising, and political actors have paid billions in order to get their messages out to their masspersonal audiences. 

Combine the two and you get politicians paying to stoke conspiracy theories, which are spread by misinformed people, who flag their support for politicians, who pay for more ads ad infinitum, ad nauseam.

As media studies scholar Gavin Mueller quipped (unfortunately, on Twitter), the QAnon conspiracy was too much for 4chan(?), but once it got to Facebook and its audience of "boomers with computers" "doing the research," it exploded. And right-wing politicians gleefully amplified the messages, from Georgia's Marjorie Taylor Greene all the way up to Donald Trump.

But this week, Facebook and Twitter de-platformed Trump. It was intriguing to watch each corporation one-up the other. Twitter flagged Trump tweets as disputed. Facebook took down a Trump video. Twitter suspended Trump for 12 hours. Facebook banned Trump for the remainder of his time in office.

Problem solved, right?

Ugh.

It should have happened a long time ago. 

But it couldn't have. Because these platforms *monetize content.* And that means what's popular, what spreads, what keeps attention is privileged. Full stop. And who or what has been the single greatest corporate media sensation arguably of all time? Donald J. Trump.

#@donaldjtrump@magainstance.social: A Thought Experiment

What does this have to do with FOSS Academics?

In a word, Mastodon, the federated, open source alternative social media platform that was *literally designed* to disallow advertising and allow people to moderate the content. 

To be blunt: Trump would have been kicked off Mastodon ages ago. 

Properly speaking, he would have been defederated aged ago.

Let's do a thought experiment. In 2017, Trump (or one of his assistants) noticed the hype about Mastodon and decided to mirror his Twitter content there. 

If you know how Mastodon works -- how federation works -- you immediately ask: which instance would Trump have used?
