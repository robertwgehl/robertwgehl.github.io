Many people lament the conflation of "fediverse" with "Mastodon."

Christine and Morgan Lemmer-Webber observed it's a bit like the 2000s conflation of Ubuntu with Linux.

But I've found a domain where the fediverse is not conflated with Mastodon.

Instead, it's conflated with Pleroma.

Perhaps none of this is bad. If computer scientists want to scrape Pleroma instances that haven't bothered prohibiting scraping, and then claim "the fediverse is poorly moderated," then the rest of us can go on setting up moderated ActivityPub-based servers with codes of conduct.
