=============================

"does deplatforming work and what happens when it's attempted?"

Deplatforming not only works, it should be built into the system. Social media should have mechanisms by which racist, transphobic speakers are removed, where misinformation is removed, and where there is no way to pay to have your messages amplified. And the decision to deplatform someone should be decided as close to democratically as is possible, rather than in some opaque "Supreme Court"-like system. 

In other words, we need alternative social media like Mastodon. As a federated system, Mastodon is specifically designed to give users and administrators the ability to mute, block, or even remove not just misbehaving users, but entire parts of the network. For example, despite fears that the alt-right network Gab would somehow take over the Mastodon federation, Mastodon administrators quickly marginalized Gab. The same thing is happening as I write with other racist and misogynistic networks. And Mastodon nodes have also prevented spam and advertising from spreading across the network.

Moreover, the decision to block or defederate with parts of the network aren't made in secret. They're done by local administrators, who are answerable to the members of their node in the network. I'm on scholar.social, an academic-oriented Mastodon node, and if I don't like a decision the local administrator makes, I can contact them directly and discuss it. 

The danger of mainstream, corporate social media is that it was built to do exactly the opposite of what alternatives like Mastodon do: grow at all costs. It turns out that it's not cute cats that draw attention, but conspiracy theories, misinformation, and the stoking of bigotry. So long as those things can be monetized, corporate socia media will continue to do so.

Donald Trump moving to new platform

I've been studying alternative social media for over a decade now, and I have seen a consistent pattern. ASM that promise unfettered free speech devolve into racism, transphobia, conspiracy theorists, and white nationalism really, really quickly (that is, if they don't get taken over by pedophiles first).

The Cheap Talk Skepticism argument helps understand why: the high cost of free speech is that everything gets undermined.

Spinning up a brand-new social networking site takes a great deal of effort. If Trump et al do so, they'll get a lot of attention at first, but very quickly will run into scaling problems and network effects issues.
