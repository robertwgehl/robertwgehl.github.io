For about a year I've been teasing at Goal 2 for this blog, which is to write a book about FOSS. It's probably not surprising to hear that I needed to narrow that focus down. FOSS is a massive phenomenon, and any given area within it deserves lengthy analysis. For example, Biella Coleman's classic book [*Coding Freedom*](https://www.powells.com/book/coding-freedom-the-ethics-aesthetics-of-hacking-9780691144610) focuses heavily on the Debian distribution. One could imagine similar books about the Linux Kernel, or Canonical, or Arch, or web servers. 

Given my background as a scholar, however, it makes sense that I should pursue a **book-length project focusing on FOSS social media.**
