The Brave Browser is now offering a search. I often listen to FOSS podcasts (name a few) and the feeling I get is, well, good on them for trying, but you just can't beat Google. I've heard academics say the same thing. I can't find anything without Google.

I just finisehd up a co-authored book (title link) and I'm here as a living testament to the fact that yes, you can de-Google your search and still conduct research.

Mostly.

Startpage (brings in google results)

DuckDuckGo (raw is working)

Brave looks intriguing.

Can't get away from Google Scholar, though. But I do a lot of work with Worldcat.org.
