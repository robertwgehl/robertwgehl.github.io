tumblr is coming to the Fediverse. This is fascinating. Maybe terrifying, I don't know. I'm not as familiar with tumblr as others. I know people loved tumblr -- just read TKTKTK's book. 

But tumblr is corporate social media. It's ad-supported, algorithmically curated.

I'm going to set aside judgement about tumblr here, and instead consider the other side of things: ActivityPub. Why haven't more corporations adopted ActivityPub?

History of AP and corporate outreach. 

They tried. Really hard. They reached out to Facebook, Twitter, Google, Weibo. And they heard nothing. At that point in time, those sites were very invested in a siloed way of organization.

The Musk takeover is just part of the change. Blueskies.
