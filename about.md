# About page

Hi! This blog is meant to do two things. 

First, one goal is to explore life as a **"FOSS Academic"** -- someone who uses Free and Open Source technologies to do academic work. I'm hoping that my discussions of FOSS technologies in an academic setting help others -- students, professors, university administrators -- understand the benefits and values of FOSS in the academy. I'm not a developer, but I am a professor who's been using FOSS to do his job for over a decade. I call this goal of exploring FOSS tools in the academy **[Goal 1](/tags/goal 1.html)**.

Second, this blog has **[Goal 2](/tags/goal 2.html)**: writing a book about a FOSS topic. After some consideration, I decided to write a book about [Mastodon and the fediverse](https://moveslowlybuildbridges.com). The book is out now! Sometimes, the two topics will collide in a single post. My intent here is to be more open about my own research process and writing.

Now that the book is done, I guess soon I will make Goal 2 be about... another book! Stay tuned for more.

You can learn more about the goals of the blog in the [introductory post](/2020/11/27/introduction.html).

As for me, I'm [Robert W. Gehl](https://www.robertwgehl.org), a professor of Communication and Media Studies at York University. My actual title is long: Ontario Research Chair of Digital Governance for Social Justice. The long title basically means I do research and teaching at York. I've also been a Fulbright Canada Research Chair of Communication, Media, and Film at the University of Calgary. Besides my new Mastodon/fediverse book, I've written three books: [*Reverse Engineering Social Media*](http://tupress.temple.edu/book/1115), which won the Association of Internet Researchers Nancy Baym Book Award, [*Weaving the Dark Web*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/weaving-dark-web), and [*Social Engineering*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262543453/) (co-authored with Sean Lawson). I've also published over two dozen peer-reviewed journal articles in venues such as *New Media & Society*, *Communication Theory,* and *Social Media + Society.*
