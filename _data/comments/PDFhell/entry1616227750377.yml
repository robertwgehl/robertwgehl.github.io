  I have made good experience with Qoppa PDF Studio
  (https://www.qoppa.com/pdfstudio/). Although it is not FOSS, the developers
  react quickly and provide comprehensive feed-back. There are academic
  licenses:

  replaces Adobe Acrobat Professional in almost all aspects, I even like the UX
  better in PDF Studio
