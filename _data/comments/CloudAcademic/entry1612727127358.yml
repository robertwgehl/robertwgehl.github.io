message: "This is a really useful post. Have bookmarked it.\r\n\r\nI cannot compare it with XMPP, but I am happy with Matrix for chatting. You should just do everything what is recommended when making an account. The on-boarding suggests you can do it later, that is where many problems come from, at least for me and some people I know.\r\n\r\nJitsi is great for talking to a few students. I prefer BigBlueButton, especially for larger groups. https://bigbluebutton.org\r\n\r\nThe next stage of FOSS mastery is to embed BBB in a H5P homepage. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H5P"
